			<h2>Translation</h2>

			<p>
				In the Year <i>Zunli</i> 213, the Zunli Emperor of the Yin dynasty caught illness, and passed. His wife, Cai Yin Airos, took the throne as regent. Empress Dowager Airos ruled her country for a full 32 years. Her rule was kind, albiet weak. In <i>Zunli</i> 240, the people suffered a great famine, which caused great suffering and thus revolt. The common people rose up in rebellion at the ineffective rule, and many of Dragonkind were slain. The Empress Dowager was captured, tortured, and then slain also, an act that stirred deep resentment and hatred amongst the Draconic Lords towards the rebels. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In <i>Zunli</i> 245, the Yin Dynasty was finally extinguished. In the ensuing civil war, the Empress Dowager's brother, Zhang Yujing (given name Hakaeron) of the Four Gorges Zhang Clan (Sixia Zhang), declared himself as the Xindai Emperor of Zhang. His campaign, however, did not go successfully, and he and many dragonkind fled westwards, to the Damak Valley of Clan Ma (Taichuan Ma). Lord Ma welcomed the newly self-crowned monarch, and hence proclaimed him as the rightful ruler of the Ancient Empire, his dynasty of Zhang the true heirs to the imperial throne. 
			</p>

			<p>
				However opposing Zhang Yujing, in Changguan, was a human by the name of Wu Zhang'an, who proclaimed a new dynasty of Shang, and himself as its Jianyi Emperor. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, Damak, the Western Regions, and Cloudshearth (Taichuan, Xiyu, Yunxin) are governed by the Zhang, whilst most of the other regions of the former united Empire are governed by Wu Yixian, the Zulong Emperor of Shang.
