			<h2>Translation</h2>

			<p>
				In the time of the long conflict, the Elven house of Kuon controlled most of the empire. The west of the central states was ruled by the House of Ma. Lord Ma was the ruler of Damak (Taichuan) vale, and had ruled for many years. Within the central states none could disturb them. However, one power did go to war with Clan Ma, that of Luzan.
			</p>

			<p>
				The King of Luzan thought that since the central states were warring, were chaotic, if he would take advantage of this opportunity and invade the Ma State, there would be no great Emperor to protect them. Thus, he raised an army of ten thousand men and set off eastwards. Crossing the Spring of the Earth he encountered no army and no resistance, thus without pain or trouble he entered Damak vale. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Atop Yaan peak his army encamped, but the next day they saw across from them three men. They were Ma soldiers, cavalrymen. Around noon, the Luzanese scouts returned with a letter from the Ma cavalrymen, which said: "Lord Ma welcomes the King of Luzan, but begs your majesty to retreat at once. Else, these three will destroy your entire army. If you retreat at once, I will forgive this incursion."
			</p>

			<p>
				The King thought, three people could not defeat his entire army! He laughed, and said that if by tomorrow the cavalrymen remained, then they must be killed. The next day though, the men had not left, and accordingly the King ordered his soldiers to slay them. When they arrived, however, the threee cavalrymen turned into dragons, and wiped out each and every soldier, with not one person spared. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Henceforth now, it is commonly said that: <i>"Three dragons are an army"</i>.
			</p>

			<h2>Context and Explanations</h2>

			<p>
				The idiom 「三龙万军 / <i>sen rekhar laikon</i> / three dragons are an army」 has the meaning of never underestimate your enemy, or never underestimate some seemingly innocent task, especially under suspicious circumstances. It was the King of Luzan that underestimated the "three cavalrymen" of Ma, unaware that they would be revealed as three dragons in disguise (the sons of Lord Ma, not included in extract), and that as members of a powerful and ancient dragon clan they fully had the capability to decisively defeat whatever the Luzanese could muster at the time. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The <b>"central states"</b>, referred to as 中国, is the oft-used term for all small kingdoms which made up the shattered Ancient Empire. When united, fully or effectively (like the modern Xhaan dynasty) the Ancient Empire is referred to as simply the name of that dynasty, as 大商. However, more general terms are also used, such as 古代帝国, <i>Ancient Empire</i> (most common) and 安国 <i>Kingdom of Asyr</i> (note: 安 is a standin for a non-unicode character, made of radicals 日+帝, pronounced the same). 
			</p>

			<p>
				The <b>Ma Clan</b> is one of the oldest continuous family dynasties in the Ancient Empire, having pretty much always ruled the Vale of Damak to the west. They generally maintain an attitude of non-intervention in times of conflict, and are sufficiently well defended on all sides to maintain that.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Luzan</b> is a mountainous kingdom to the west, deep in the mountains, centred around a large plateau. They have a very militaristic and stratified culture, and have been known in the past to incur into Damak and surrounding regions, sometimes controlling over half of the fertile river valleys when the Ma and other western clans are at their weakest.
