				Hey, so you stumbled across this website. Welcome. I started this site in October of 2020, in an effort to have something where I could put personal projects and thoughts, as well as, well, just to make a nice looking website. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Here, all the main styling is created by me from the ground up, over many hours, including the majority of art here <i>Except those that are sourced, or are images of places</i>. <del><a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/adrakaris/shop?artistUserName=Adrakaris&asc=u&iaCode=u-prints">You can buy prints of the background too!</a></del>
			</p>

			<p>
				I made this site in my free time, alongside university work. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Do have an explore!
			</p>

			<h2>Notes and Significant Changes</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Added MathJax for latex style notes. 8th Feb.</li>
				<li>I now have my own domain name! No longer are we <code>adrakaris.github.io</code>! 30th Feb.</li>
				<li>Added Dark Mode on 7th May.</li>
				<li>Added <i>Prism</i>, which is used for code highlighting. Funnily enough the border is near invisible in dark mode, but it's <i>fiiine</i>. 11th May.</li>
				<li>Redid the top bar and added more links to home page. 13th May.</li>
				<li>I've gone and learned javascript (well, not really, just kinda improvised based off extensive google searches and knowledge of programming in other languages) and made a new blog page! We now have a shiny new page with a search bar and dates and everything and it is amazing. 27th May.</li>
				<li>Added a script to the home page to display the three most recent articles from my blog. 9th July.</li>
				<li>Started working on a Chinese version. 8th August.</li>
			</ul>
