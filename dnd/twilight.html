        <h1>Notes on the Twilight Vale</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>Twilight Vale</i>, alternatively the 靈界 (ling jie), is the home plane of elven kind, and is almost a mirror to the material plane (the fan jie, 凡界).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is, as the name suggests, eternally bathed in twilight. Whilst in the Material Plane, there is one sun and one moon that rotates through the sky, the Twilight works a little different. In the far south, there are said to be three suns, eternally shining, bathing the far oceans in scorching heat. This is said to be the domain of the Summer God Ceri. In the far north, there are said to be seven cold moons, their baleful light freezing the far north into an icy winter, the domain of the Winter Goddess Mari. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Being in the middle, thereabouts, the inhabited continents are thus in eternal twilight, and the most suited to habitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the landmasses - at least the known ones - are of the same shape, and it is said that often, where elves build, humans may find ruins in the material plane, and vice versa, though there may be no rhyme nor reason for this occurence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Twilight is a lot more dangerous than the Material Plane, with many more untamed, wild, and dangerous lands, and many more other races unknown or rarely seen (異族).
        </p>

        <h2>Landmasses and Regions</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>
            The area of which we would call <i>East Aseron</i> in the Material Plane, is called the Tianyuan Continent (天元大陸) in the Twilight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Of its surrounding areas, the Mountains of Heaven and Earth are called the Kwunwu Mountains (昆吾山脉), and to their west is the Syiafeng Continent (夏風大陸). To the east are the island territories known as the Syuanyang Oceans (玄陽海域), beyond which is the vast and expansive Chian ocean (乾海), and to the north are the untamed lands (蠻荒北域).
        </p>

        <h3>天元大陸 Tianyuan</h3>

        <p>
            The Tianyuan continent occupies the region of the Ancient Empire, and its surrounding lands. A hub of civilisation, the settled regions are commonly referred to as the <i>Seven Territories and Three Realms</i> (七地三境 san yuan chi jing). 
        </p>
        <p>
            The three realms are the larger of the territories, and where the most people live. Each of them is ruled by a "king", who is a cultivator of the <i>hwashen</i> (化神) rank - being of 20th level. The territories themselves take after the names of the kings, thus Fengyuan 馮元 for the Fengyuan Realm 馮元境, Hwaiyuan 淮元 for the Huaiyuan Realm 淮元境, and Nanlung 南隴 for the Nanlung Realm 南隴境.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Seven Territories are the smaller, border marches, where fewer people live, sightings of other races are more common, and where generally life is harder, but the untamed lands can present many hidden treasures. These seven lands are, clockwise from northwest, Wan Jyu 萬居, Syu Di 戌地, Chr Di 蚩地, 庚地 Geng Di, 瀟地 Syiao Di, 喬地 Chiao Di, and 雚地 Gwan Di.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst their names may change throughout the millennia, their border are largely static, with little territorial conflict as seen in the Material plane.
        </p>

        <h4>昆吾山脉 The Kwunwu Mountains</h4>

        <p>
            Equivalent to the Mountains of Heaven and Earth in the material plane, the Kwunwu mountains, rather than being a lush haven that brought forth the Yan, is instead a place where the primordial spirit of the fey is unstable, with many world tears floating around. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Magic can go awry here, and in the lake that would be called the world spring, sits a whirlpool of pure primordial energy, the resonance of which can easily blow away a cultivator's magic (or <i>qi</i>) and evaporate their soul. Thus, whilst the mountains are indeed home to groves of magical plants and precious medicines, and all manner of elemental wonders, few dare to go there. 
        </p>

        <h3>夏風大陸 Syiafeng</h3>

        <p>
            The Syiafeng continent is separated from Tianyuan by the Kwunwu mountians, and, unlike the Material Plane where the majority of the region is occupied by desert, Syiafeng is mostly home to savannahs and forests, often with dark, purple leaves. It is a place home to comparatively few compared to Tianyuan, and there are no "realms", rather lone city states, or small settlements dotted throughout the landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beasts of the fey run wild, and it is a dangerous but beautiful land. Teleportation arrays connect some of the cities of Syiafeng, as well as them to the realms of Tianyuan, providing safe travel to those who could afford it. Otherwise, a traveller would do well to keep away from the shadows, from the mountains, and the dark forests where the beasts lie. 
        </p>

        <h3>玄陽海域 Syuanyang Sea</h3>

        <p>
            The Syuanyang Sea is home to one power: the so-called House of Syuanyang 玄陽府, which controlls all the islands in this part of the sea. The land corresponds with the Sea of Shattered Stars in the Material Plane. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the sea, powerful creatures lurk, much more powerful than those found on land. Notably, in the seas (as well as those in the Material Plane, though none have seen them) live a race of dragons, with long, serpentine bodies, and no wings, yet are able to fly through the air like they swim in water, and the ability to control the rain and thunder. They are the <i>sea dragons</i> 蛟龍, the leviathans that would make a regular winged dragon cower - and it is said that the ruler of the Syuanyang House, Syuanyang himself, belongs to this race, and thus is why the Syuanyang house has ruled these islands for countless millennia.
        </p>

        <h3>乾海 Chian Ocean</h3>

        <p>
            The Chian ocean is the name given to the entire ocean east and south of Tianyuan, and is the endless ocean that expands as far as anyone has been able to fly. As mentioned, the oceans are vast and dangerous, and those who venture deep scarce return. Apart from Syuanyang's domain, few, if any islands jut out of this vast ocean, making life even more treacherous. 
        </p>

        <h4>南凱一天綫 The Nan Kai One Line Sky</h4>

        <p>
            An area of the ocean south of Tianyuan, the Nankai Sky is characterised by a gleaming white line stretching to the horizons. Below this white line is darkness, and a bitter cold, and above it are scorching, orange winds, and the "One Line Sky" is the boundary where they meet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This area of the water is impassable, except for going through the boundary region in the middle. Even here, the winds are mighty and vicious, and none but the most powerful can survive, and even then only for a short time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The one line sky stretches on for an unfathomable distance southwards, and its northern border bulges out and sinks in, with the closest it gets to the continent being south many thousand <i>li</i> from the Tianyuan continent.
        </p>

        <h3>蠻荒北域 The Wild North</h3>

        <p>
            The North is an icy, wild, untamed land, scarce visited except by the most powerful of cultivators, and even then the danger to them is nothing trivial. Many places are untouched, explored, whilst many others are home to magical beasts, or even other races, with their own civilisations and realms lying out of reach. The further north one goes, the colder it gets, much like Marakar in the material plane, until none can bear the frost. The further north one goes as well, the darker it gets, as one would be travelling closer to the moons, and further from the suns.
