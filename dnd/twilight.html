        <h1>Notes on the Twilight Vale</h1>

        <p>
            The <i>Twilight Vale</i>, alternatively the 靈界 (ling jie), is the home plane of elven kind, and is almost a mirror to the material plane (the fan jie, 凡界).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is, as the name suggests, eternally bathed in twilight. Whilst in the Material Plane, there is one sun and one moon that rotates through the sky, the Twilight works a little different. In the far south, there are said to be three suns, eternally shining, bathing the far oceans in scorching heat. This is said to be the domain of the Summer God Ceri. In the far north, there are said to be seven cold moons, their baleful light freezing the far north into an icy winter, the domain of the Winter Goddess Mari. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Being in the middle, thereabouts, the inhabited continents are thus in eternal twilight, and the most suited to habitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the landmasses - at least the known ones - are of the same shape, and it is said that often, where elves build, humans may find ruins in the material plane, and vice versa, though there may be no rhyme nor reason for this occurence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Twilight is a lot more dangerous than the Material Plane, with many more untamed, wild, and dangerous lands, and many more other races unknown or rarely seen (異族).
        </p>
