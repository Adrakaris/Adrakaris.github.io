        <h2 id="cur">Currency</h2>

        <p>
            Dnd 5e uses gold, silver and copper pieces (GP, SP, CP)
        </p>
        <p>
            In the east, your main currency is instead <b>taels of pure silver</b>, 銀兩 <i>/yin liang/</i>. One tael <i>/liang/</i> is about 37 grams. One tael can be subdivided into 100 copper cash (銅文 <i>/tung wen/</i>), and 100 taels of silver is worth one tael of "hallowed silver" (尚銀), a majority-mithril alloy.
        </p>
        <p>
            One tael can be subdivided into 100 copper cash (銅文), and 100 taels of silver is worth one tael of "hallowed silver" (尚銀), a majority-mithril alloy. Copper cash can be strung together to form strings of 100 coins, which are then used as silver trading.
        </p>

        <h3>Cultivation Currency</h3>

        <p>
            In the cultivation world, common silver and copper is often disregarded in favour of <b>spirit jade</b> (靈玉, <i>/ling yu/</i>). Spirit jade is a type of stone that contains pure natural <i>qi</i>, and can be used to recover magic on the fly. Low level spirit jade is the most common, and often formed into coins for trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            One (low level) spirit coin is <i>nominally</i> worth one tael of silver, but often one may find that vendors won't accept silver at all, or place a markup.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dist">Distances</h2>

        <p>
            We'll use traditional chinese distances, namely the ones below
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 尺 (chr) is, for convenience, equal to <b>one imperial foot</b>, about 30cm
            </li>
            <li>
                1 丈 (jang) is 12 尺 (12 ft), about 3.6m
            </li>
            <li>
                1 里 (li) is 180 丈 (180 zhang or 2160 ft), about 600m
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Travel</b> in DnD (by foot) is usually 24 miles a day over flat ground (8 hrs a day at walking pace), which will get approximated to 50 li a day. You don't need to remember the conversions, I'll mostly be using "foot" and "li" anyway, just think of the latter as half a mile and you'll be good.
