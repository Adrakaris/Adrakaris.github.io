        <p>
            This page lists important mechanics which have been changed or added to to fit with the Xianxia setting.

        <p>
            Some useful mechanics which have not been changed can be found on the <i>Mechanics Reference</i> page.

        <h2 id="cur">Currency</h2>

        <p>
            Dnd 5e uses gold, silver and copper pieces (GP, SP, CP)
        </p>
        <p>
            In the east, your main currency is instead <b>taels of pure silver</b>, 銀兩 <i>/yin liang/</i>. One tael <i>/liang/</i> is about 37 grams. One tael can be subdivided into 100 copper cash (銅文 <i>/tung wen/</i>), and 100 taels of silver is worth one tael of "hallowed silver" (尚銀), a majority-mithril alloy.
        </p>
        <p>
            One tael can be subdivided into 100 copper cash (銅文), and 100 taels of silver is worth one tael of "hallowed silver" (尚銀), a majority-mithril alloy. Copper cash can be strung together to form strings of 100 coins, which are then used as silver trading.
        </p>

        <h3>Cultivation Currency</h3>

        <p>
            In the cultivation world, common silver and copper is often disregarded in favour of <b>spirit jade</b> (靈玉, <i>/ling yu/</i>). Spirit jade is a type of stone that contains pure natural <i>qi</i>, and can be used to recover magic on the fly. Low level spirit jade is the most common, and often formed into coins for trade.
        </p>
        <p>
            One (low level) spirit coin is <i>nominally</i> worth one tael of silver, but often one may find that vendors won't accept silver at all, or place a markup.
        </p>

    <div class="cbox">

        <h2 id="dist">Distances</h2>

        <p>
            We'll use traditional chinese distances, namely the ones below
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 尺 (chr) is, for convenience, equal to <b>one imperial foot</b>, about 30cm
            </li>
            <li>
                1 丈 (jang) is 12 尺 (12 ft), about 3.6m
            </li>
            <li>
                1 里 (li) is 180 丈 (180 zhang or 2160 ft), about 600m
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Travel</b> in DnD (by foot) is usually 24 miles a day over flat ground (8 hrs a day at walking pace), which will get approximated to <b>50 li a day</b>. You don't need to remember the conversions, I'll mostly be using "foot" and "li" anyway, just think of the latter as half a mile and you'll be good. 
        </p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="cbox">

        <h2 id="class">Classes and Cultivations</h2>

        <p>
            Naturally 5e classes are a basis. Class in Xianxia are split up into different paths, with Martial 武 and Daoist Magical 道 being the ones you get.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should hopefully be obvious which classes belong in which category. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The east has also developed <b>cultivation paths</b> 修道 (syiu dao), which act kind of like an extra subclass on top of your existing subclasses / archetypes, which give custom spells and abilities (this is handled by me, the DM, and is entirely homebrew). Cultivations level just like regular classes do, though the level is kept track of by me and is generally not important to know.
