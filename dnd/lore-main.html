        <h1>Chinese</h1>

        <p>
            So, naturally, this is a <i>Xianxia</i> setting, where the common language will be some sort of Chinese. There are certain pronouns and honorifics which are somewhat difficult to translate, so this will be kind of a brief vocabulary guide. Tones are omitted for convenience.
        </p>

        <h2>Yale Romanisation</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Yale romanisation</b> of Mandarin is a romanisation system created in the 60s in Yale University, and is one of the best systems for <i>english speakers</i> specifically. I will use a (slighly modified) Yale romansiation so you don't have to learn what those funny letters sound like. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some notes though, because it's not perfect:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pronounce all the letters as you'd see them in english - j and ch are hard, not soft (~ y, sh).</li>
            <li>The <i>ou</i> digraph makes an "oh" sound. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Honorifics and Titles</h2>

        <p>
            There is a (very) heavy emphasis on 敬語 (jing yu, respectful language) and 謙語 (chian yu, self-deprecating language) in chinese. Analogous to a servant calling their lord "My Lord" or "Your Excellence" and themselves "Your Servant", they tend to be a <i>little</i> more widespread and also kinda difficult to translate nicely into regular english (especially the 謙语). Generally I will try translate as appropriate, but for reference the following are given below.
        </p>

        <p>
            Honorifics and titles (like "Mr") come after the surname. "Mr" is translated to 先生 (syian sheng), though this is actually technically a gender neutral term. Mr Wu (吳) would be 吳先生 (Wu Syiansheng).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Often in chinese familial titles (e.g. brother, sister, uncle, auntie, etc) are used to refer to friends, and fellow disciples of a sect. In essence, they are your family, just not necessarily blood family. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One keyword to note is 阿姨 <b>a-yi</b> which is to chinese what babushka is to russian. 
        </p>

        <h3>Honorifics</h3>

        <p>
            To refer to the adresser (me):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>在下 (dzai syia)</li>
            <li>晚輩 (wan bei); (when talking to someone senior)</li>
            <li>小人 (syiao ren); (lit. small/mean person)</li>
            <li>貧道 (pin dao); (lit. poor daoist, from a daoist priest)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To refer to the adresee (you):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>閣下 (ge syia)</li>
            <li>足下 (dzu syia)</li>
            <li>前輩 (chian bei); (adressing someone senior)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Titles</h3>

        <p>
            These might be more commonly left untranslated. All of these are given with the surname 吳 (Wu) for reference.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>吳道友 (- dao you); cultivation friend, way cultivators address each other</li>
            <li>吳仙師 (- syian shr); immortal master, way commonfolk address cultivators</li>
            <li>吳道長 (- dao jang); master taoist, title of taoist priests</li>
        </ul>
