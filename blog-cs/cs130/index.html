                Sets, denoted like \( S = \{a, b, c, ...\} \), contain unique elements. 
                \[ \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \]

                The number of elements (<i>cardinality</i>) of a set \(A\) denoted \(|A| = n , n \in \mathbb{N}\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Recall the such that notation (: or |). Recall the empty set \(\{\}, \varnothing\). If \(|D| = 1\), D is a <i>singleton</i> set.

            <p>
                Suppose \(A = \{a, b, c\}\). Then we denote \( A^2 = \{aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, cc\} \), and \(A^n\) is the set of all ordered sequences of length \(n\) of elements in A. Ex. \(\mathbb{Z}^2\) is the set of ordered integer pairs (i.e. integer coordinates). Tuple brackets are usually kept on unless no ambiguity can be had without them on.

            <h2 id="set-3">More on Sets</h2>

            <p>
                Let \( A = \{2, \{3, 4, 5\}, 6, \varnothing \} \). \( |A| = 4 \). We can say that \( A \not \subseteq B \equiv \exists x \in A : x \not \in B \). We also have \( A \varsubsetneq B \) which is an alternate syntax of \( A \subset B \), and means \( A \subseteq B \land A \neq B \). The empty set \( \varnothing \subseteq B, \forall B \).
            </p>

            <p>
                Set ranges, let \( C = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq 5\} \) can also be denoted as \( C = (-\infty, 5] \) or the same using a semicolon vs a comma.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can define the set operations as follows:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        \( A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \lor x \in B\} \)

                    <li>
                        \( A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \land x \in B\} \)

            <p>
                We can define <i>symmetric difference</i> as \( A \vartriangle B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \).

            <p class="side">

                    For the forward proof, let us take an arbitrary \( x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \). We have two cases:

                    \begin{align}
                    \textrm{(1) } x \in A \setminus B &\implies x \in A  \\
                    &\implies x \in A \cup B.  \\
                    x \in A \setminus B &\implies x \not \in B  \\
                    &\implies x \not \in A \cap B  \\
                    &\implies x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B). \triangleright  \\

                    \textrm{(2) } x \in B \setminus A &\implies x \in B  \\
                    &\implies x \in A \cup B.  \\
                    x \in B \setminus A &\implies x \not \in A  \\
                    &\implies x \not \in A \cap B  \\
                    &\implies x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B). \triangleright   \\
                    \end{align}

                    We have now proved the forward condition. For the backward proof, let us take an arbitrary element \( x \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B) \).

                    \begin{align}
                    &x \in A \cup B \\
                    &x \in A \cup B \implies x \in A \lor x \in B \\
                    &\textrm{if } x \in A \implies x \not \in B \textrm{ else contradiction as } x \in A \cap B \implies x \not \in (A \cup B) \setminus (A \cap B)\\
                    &\therefore x \in A \setminus B \\
                    &\textrm{if } x \in B \implies x \not \in A \textrm{ else similar contradiction} \\
                    &\therefore x \in B \setminus A\\
                    &\therefore x \in (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A).

                We can trivially define the following:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Idempotence<br>

            </p>

            <p>
                For negation, we need to do some defining. Set minus is not negation, since we need 2 sets for set minus. So suppose then we have a universal set \( S \). For any set \( A \subseteq S \), the complement of A relative to S is the difference, \( \bar{A} = S \setminus A \). Thus, \( \bar{\bar{A}} = A \).
            </p>

            <p>
                We also can define De Morgan's law, as <br>
                \[ \overline{A \cap B} = \bar{A} \cup \bar{B} \textrm{ and } \overline{A \cup B} = \bar{A} \cap \bar{B} \]
                In case the overlines don't show up, that is the complement of A intersect B equals the compliment of A union the compliment of B. And similarly with the \(\cup, \cap\) reversed.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can then define the following,

                \begin{align*}
                &A \cap S = A \ &A \cup \varnothing = A \\  
                &A \cap \varnothing \ &A \cup S = S \\
                &A \cap \bar{A} = \varnothing \ &A \cup \bar{A} = S \\            
                \end{align*}
                \[A \cap (A \cup B) = A = A \cup (A \cap B)\]

                The last of which is a <b>theorem</b> and deducible. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We have notation for when we want to perform an operation over many sets. This is similar to summation notation.

                \[ \bigcup^{n}_{i=1} A_i \]

                indicates that we want to perform set union on all sets A of index i to n. Similarly, for set intersection, we have

                \[ \bigcap^{n}_{i=1} A_i \]
            </p>

            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 1.</i></b> Let a set \( A_i = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \geq i, i \in \mathbb{N}\}\) for some index i. Then, we can play around with some operations using these large operators.

                \begin{align*}
                &\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = A_1;\
                &\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = \varnothing; \
                &\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i = A_n;
                \end{align*}

                More generally, for a set of indices \( I \), we can write

                \begin{align}
                \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i &= \{x : x \in A_i \textrm{ for some } i \in I\} \\
                \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i &= \{x : x \in A_i \textrm{ for all } i \in I\} \\
                \end{align}

                Note that the first is how \( \exists \) works, whilst the second is how \( \forall \) works.

            <h2 id="set-5">Power Sets</h2>

            <p>
                Given a set S the <i>power set</i> is the set of all subsets of S.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let \( S_1 = \varnothing \), then \( 2^{S_1} = \{\varnothing\} \)<br>
                Let \( S_2 = \{a, b\} \), then \( 2^{S_2} = \{\varnothing, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\} \) <br>
                And so on. All subsets of a set are elements of its power set.
            </p>

            <p>
                A finite set gives a finite power set. If the cardinality of a set \( |S| = n \), the caridnality of its power set \( |2^{S}| = 2^{|S|} = 2^n \). This also shows why the power set notation is as thus.
            </p>

            <h2 id="set-6">Cartesian Products</h2>

            <p>
                Recall: for a set \( A, A^2 = \{(a_1, a_2) : a_i \in A, a_2 \in A\} \). Etc. for \( A^n \). The cartesian product for two sets, \( A \times B \), is defined similarly, as \( \{(a, b) : a \in A, b \in B\} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                What happens when we take a cartesian product \( A \times \varnothing \)? Well, since \( \varnothing \) has 0 elements, if we look at the defnition the resulting set must have 0 elements, as we cannot have any ordered pairs, thus \( A \times \varnothing = \varnothing = \varnothing \times A \).
            </p>

            <p>
                On associativity and commutativity, cartesian product is not commutative, as by switching around the sets we switch around the <i>ordered</i> pairs. On associativity, suppose \( (A \times B) \times C \).

                \begin{align}
                (A \times B) \times C &= \{(x, y) : x \in A \times B, y \in C\} \\
                &= \{(x, y) : [x = (a, b):a \in A, b \in B], y \in C\} \\
                &= \{((a,b),c): a \in A, b \in B, c \in C\} \\
                \textrm{However } A \times (B \times C) &= \{(a,(b,c)): a \in A, b \in B, c \in C\} \textrm{ which is different. }
                \end{align}

                So cartesian product is not associative, either.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can define \( A \times B \times C = \{(a,b,c) : a \in A, b \in B, c \in C\} \), and extrapolate for further product chains.

                Propositions allow us to express statements which can be true or false. "Washington DC is the capital of the US" is a true proposition, whilst "2+2=5" is a false one.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sentences like "What time is it?", "Read this carefully", are not propositions. "\(x+2=5\)" is not a proposition, but could be <b>iff</b> x was fixed beforehand.
            </p>

            <p>
                Atomic propositions are propositions that cannot be broken down further, they are usually represented by a letter, \(p, q\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Propositions can be compounded with logical operators \(\lnot, \land, \lor\). These are Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction respectively. Conjunction, \(P \land Q\) can also be written \(PQ\).
            </p>

            <p>
                An implication, "<i>if P then Q</i> " or "<i>P implies Q</i> " is denoted \(P \implies Q\), and equals \(\lnot P \lor Q\).

            <h2 id="pnq-1">Predicates and Quantifiers</h2>

            <p>
                A predicate is a statement that can contain a variable, and is either true or false. For example, \(P_{1}(u)\) where u is the variable, which is in a domain, such as \(u \in \mathbb{Z}\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Variables can be bound by quantifiers, \(\forall u\) and \(\exists u\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Let the predicate \(P_{2}(u): u^2 - 1 = (u-1)(u+1)\), we can then construct sentences using quantifiers and predicates, \(\forall u \in \mathbb{Z}, P_{2}(u)\). For all integers u such that the predicate holds. This can be done without the domain if domain is implied, but this is usually <i>not well defined</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let \(P_{3}(u): u^2 = 9\). Then \(\forall u \in \mathbb{Z}, P_{3}(u)\) is false, since we can provide a counterexample.
            </p>

            <p>
                A variable bound by a quantifier is called, well, a <i>bound variable</i>, whilst otherwise it is a <i>free variable</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: \(\exists\) is usually used with a colon ("such that"), whilst \(\forall\) is not.
            </p>

            <p>
                Predicates can be over multiple variables. Let \(P_{4}(x, y):(x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)\). Then we can say \(\exists x \exists y : P_{1}(x,y)\) or \(\forall x \forall y , P_1 (x,y)\), which are both true.
            </p>
            
            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 1.</i></b> Let \(P_5 (x,y) : (x-1)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 0\). <br><br>
                We can say that \(\exists x \exists y : P_5 (x,y)\) is true (\(x=1, y=3\)), whilst \(\forall x \forall y : P_5 (x,y)\) is false, since we can find a trivial example in \(x=0, y=0\).
            </p>
            

            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 2.</i></b> Let \(q(u, v) : | u-v| = 1\). <br><br>
                For the sentence \(\forall u \exists v : q(u,v)\), we can say that this is true, since we can pick \(v=u+1\). <br><br>
                However the sentence \(\exists v : \forall u, q(u,v)\) is problematic, since there is an exception for the value of u for all values of v. So this is false.
            </p>

            <p>
                (Dimitry's analogy) Sentences with quantifiers act like a game between 2 players. \(\exists\) wants to pick values of its variable for a true value, whilst \(\forall\) wants to pick values which are false.

                    For (B), \(p(A, 1)\) is false, so the sentence is false. <br><br>
    
                    For (C), note that u and v are switched round. However, variable names are really arbitrary, and \(\forall v \exists u: p(v,u) \equiv \forall u \exists v: p(u,v)\), since they     are just labels at the end of the day. This is then saying tat for all rows there is a column that is true, which is true. So the sentence is true. <br><br>
    
                    For (D), we need to be slightly more careful. Using u and v here may get confusing, since it clashes with the u and v used in the definition, so first let us write it in terms of  other variables: \(\exists x \forall y, p(y,x)\). What this is saying is that "there exists a column, such that for all rows that column is true." Since column 4 is true, this  sentence is true.

                Sometimes, we want for a <i>unique</i> item to exist. Currently, \(\exists\) means "one or more", however a shorthand to say "exactly one" is \(\exists!\). This is formally defined as:

                \[ \exists! x \in S : P(x) = ( \exists x : P(x) ) \land \forall y \in S \forall x \in S, ( (P(y) \land P(z) ) \implies y = z \]

                Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \) and \( m, n \) do not share common factors. Then,

                This means that both \( m,n \) divisible by 2, which contradicts our original conditon that \( m,n \) share no common factors. Since this is a contradiction, \( 2 \not \in \mathbb{Q} \).

                <br><br>
                The third sentence describes (W) \( \lnot m \implies \lnot f \lor p \), which is what we want to verify is a logical consequence of the first three predicates. This is saying, \( X \land Y \land Z \implies W \)? (<i>recall for the following that \( p \implies q \equiv \lnot p \lor q \)</i>).
                <br><br>
                We can do this by trying to verify if \( X \land Y \land Z \land \lnot W \) is false.

                \begin{align}
                X \land Y \land Z \land \lnot W &\equiv ((a \land q) \implies m) \land (f \implies q) \land (\lnot p \implies a) \land \lnot m \land \lnot (\lnot f \lor p) \\

                \end{align} 

                Note that de Morgan's law was applied to \( \lnot (\lnot f \lor p) \). Once we have everything in this mode we can use <b><i>modus ponens</i></b> to resolve this down.

                \[ (\lnot a \lor \lnot q \lor m) \land (\cancel {\lnot f} \lor q) \land (\cancel {p} \lor a) \land \lnot m \land f \land \lnot p \]

                \[ (\lnot \cancel{a} \lor  \cancel{\lnot q} \lor m) \land q \land a \land \lnot m \land \lnot p \]

                \[ m \land q \land a \land \lnot m \land \lnot p \]

                Note that here we have \( m \land \lnot m \), which will evaluate to false, making the whole expression false. Since this is the opposite expression, we can say that the original reasoning is correct.

                There are a lot of freedoms with relations, and how large they are. An <i>empty relation</i> is \( R = \varnothing \), whilst a <i>total relation</i> is \( R = A \times B \).

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Definition.</i></b> The <b>inverse</b> of a relation \( R \subseteq A \times B \) is denoted \( R^{-1} \), where \( R^{-1} = \{(b,a) \in B \times A : (a,b) \in R \} \) This is a relation from B to A. 
            </p>

            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 3.</i></b> Let us define \( R = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \{0, 1\}: x \textrm{ has remainder } y \textrm{ mod } 2\} \). In this case, all tuples \( (x,0) \) are even \( x \)s, whilst all tuples \( (x, 1) \) are odd \( x \)s.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since relations are sets themselves, therefore we can also perform set operations on relations, such as \( R_1 \cup R_2 \), \( R_1 \cap R_2 \), \( R_1 \setminus R_2 \). 
            </p>

            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 4.</i></b> Relations can be abstract or concrete. Take a set \( P \) of people, we can define a relation over the set of people as \( R = \{(x,y) \in P^2 : x \textrm{ is a child of } y\} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                Since relations can either hold or not for elements from a sets, relations can also be thought of as predicates. For example, for relation \( R, \; R(x,y) \) is the predicate. If \( R(a,b) : a \in A , b \in B \) then the pair \( (a,b) \in R \).
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of writing \( (a,b) \in R \), which may be tedious, one can simply write \( aRb \) where R is the relation, or can be replaced with the denotation of the relation. For example, for a relation \( R_{\leq} \), we can write \( (a,b) \in R_{\leq} \), \( (a,b) \in \leq \), or more commonly \( a \leq b \).

            </p>

            <p>
                Relation (1) is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric and transitive.
            </p>

            <p>
                Relation (2) is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, but <i>not</i> symmetric. Try find a counterexample in the not case.
            </p>

                Relation (4) is not reflexive. No one can be a child of themself.<br>
                Relation (4) is also not symmetric. A parent cannot be a child of their own child. <br>
                Relation (4) is not transitive. If \( a \) is the child of \( b \), and \( b \) is the child of \( c \), then \( a \) is the <i>grandchild</i>, and not child, of \( c \)
            </p>

                How about for antisymmetry of (4)? Does \( a \) being a child of \( b \), and \( b \) being a child of \( a \), imply that \( a \) is \( b \)? The problem here is, there is no pair \( a,b \) possible for this, so \( aRb \land bRa \) is <i>always</i> false. Since false always implies true, (4) <i>is</i> antisymmetric.

                It is still meaningful to talk about operations over these quotient sets, such as addition, which can be defined as a function \( + : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \). This is compatible over \( R_m \), as we can simply do things like \( 11 + 5 = 4 \).

                For example, take the pairs \( (3, 6), (21, 42) \). Since \( 3 \cdot 42 = 6 \cdot 21 \), (out * out = in * in), these two pairs belong to the relation R. What this can represent is a ratio: \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{21}{42} \).

            <h2>Graphs as Relations</h2>

            <p>
                First, let us say that a relation which is <b>irreflexive</b> is the opposite of reflexive, that is for a relation \( R \), \( \forall a \in A, \; \lnot (aRa) \)
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Definition.</i></b> A graph is an ordered pair \( G = (V, E) \), where:
                <br><br>
                \( V \) is a set of vertices, with \( |V| < \infty \), and \( E \) is a <i>collection</i> of edges (vertex pairs).                  
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that a <i>collection</i> allows duplicates of the same object, since it is useful to have that sometimes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Graphs are either <b>Directed or Undirected</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                In a directed graph (digraph), E must <b>strictly</b> contain ordered pairs. In an undirected graph, \( (u, v) = (v, u) \) and so one can think rather of a <i>collection</i> \( \{u, v\} \in E \).
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Vocabulary. </i></b>For an edge \( (u, v) \), \( u \) is the <b>source</b>, or initial vertex, and \( v \) is the <b>destination</b>, or terminal vertex. 
                <br><br>
                A <b>Loop</b> is represented \( (u, u) \), i.e. a vertex connecting to itself. 
                <br><br>
                Edges \( \{u, v\} \) and \( \{v, u\} \) are parallel, but directed edges \( (u,v) \) and \( (v,u) \) are <b>not</b> parallel.
            </p>

                Let us have no parallel edges, for ease. 
                <br><br>
                The Edges, \( E \subseteq V \times V \) is a relation, and if it is symmetric, then the graph is undirected*, else the graph is directed.
                <br><br>
                If \( E \) is irreflexive, there are no loops in the graph.
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Definition.</i></b> A graph is <b>SIMPLE</b> if it is undirected, and there are <i>no loops or parallel edges</i>.
                <br><br>
                A <b>simple digraph</b> is similar to the above, but the graph is directed.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a graph does have parallel edges, the relation \( E \subseteq V \times V \) breaks down. However, we can instead make \( E \) a function \( e : V \times V \longrightarrow \mathbb{N} \), so then \( e((u,v)) = 2 \) means there are two edges connecting \( u \) to \( v \).
            </p>

            <p>
                Vertices and edges can be labelled, and we can define a function for each going to the set of labels \( L \) to retrieve the lables (for some reason). \( f : V \longrightarrow L \) and \( g : E \longrightarrow L \).
            </p>

            <p>
                A graph is <b>weighted</b> if we have numbers as labels.

                <b><i>Vocabulary.</i></b> Vertices are <b>adjacent</b> if an edge connects them.
                <br><br>
                An edge \( e= (u, v) \) is <b>incident</b> with \( u \) or \( v \). Alternatively, \( u, v \) are the <b>endpoints</b> of \( e \).
                <br><br>
                The <b>degree</b> of a vertex \( \textrm{Degree}(v) \) is the number of edges incident with \( v \).
                <br><br>
                For directed graphs, the <b>indegree</b> is the number of edges where \( v \) is a destination, and the <b>outdegree</b> is the number of edges where \( v \) is a source.

                    We can plug the new cycle into the original cycle by adjusting the paths to \(u \longrightarrow^* v_i\) followed by \(C' : v_i \longrightarrow^* v_i\) then \(v_i \longrightarrow^* u\).

                    Consider \(i = k\). Then \(v_k\) on \(C\), \(v_k = w\) so \(w\) is on \(C\). Again the degree of \(w = 0\), which is a cycle (by <i>lemma 2</i>).

            <p>
                We can build larger posets from smaller ones. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Suppose we have posets \((P, \leq_P), (Q, \leq_Q)\), what would be \((P \times Q, ?)\)? Let us try over an example of lexocographical ordering over sets of words \(P, Q\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Define \(\leq_{\textrm{lex}}\) as the lexicographical ordering partial order. We can then define:
                \begin{align}
                (p_1, q_1) \leq_{\textrm{lex}} (p_2, q_2) &\textrm{ iff} &p_1 <_P p_2 \\
                &\textrm{  or} &p_1 = p_2 \land q_1 \leq_Q q_2
                \end{align}
                Where \(x < y\) is just \(x \leq y \land x \neq y\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, we can use component-wise ordering. Let us define a generic partial order \(\leq_\textrm{pr}\) ("pr" for product) as this partial order. Here,
                
                \[(p_1, q_1) \leq_{\textrm{lex}} (p_2, q_2) \textrm{ iff } p_1 \leq p_2 \land q_1 \leq q_2\]
            </p>

            <p class="side">
                <b><i>Example 4.</i></b> Let \(P = \{0, 1\}\).
                <br><br>
                Define a relation \(\leq\) as:
                \[
                \leq = \begin{cases}
                1 \leq 1
                &0 \leq 0\\
                0 \leq 1
                &1 \not \leq 0\\
                \end{cases}
                \]
                We can draw this relation simply as \(0 \longrightarrow 1\). 
                <br><br>
                We now want the product \((P, \leq) \times (P, \leq)\). \(P^2 = \{00, 01, 10, 11\}\), and now let's check this with our two known ordering methods.
                <br><br>
                If we use lexicographical order, then the graph looks like \(00 \longrightarrow 01 \longrightarrow 10 \longrightarrow 11\), which means from a total order we get yet another total order.
                <br><br>
                If we use component-wise order, then (bear with me here) the graph looks something like \(00 \longrightarrow (01, 10) \longrightarrow 11\), where \(01, 10\) are incomparable. Here, from a total order we have something which is not a total order.

                <b><i>Notation.</i></b> A <b>SAMPLE SPACE</b>, denoted \(\Omega\) is a set of all possible outcomes. 
                <br><br>
                Consider a 6 sided dice. The sample space would be \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), where the elements of the set are <B>ELEMENTARY OUTCOMES</B>.
                <br><br>
                An <b>EVENT</b> \(E\) is a subset of the sample space, \(E \subseteq \Omega\). (can be denoted with any, often capital, letter)
            </p>

            <p>
                For a 6 sided die, we can have the events even (\(E = \{2, 4, 6\}\)), odd (\(O = \{1, 3, 5\}\)), and small (\(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\)) as examples of events.
            </p>

            <p>
                We can then perform set operations on these events. For example, \(O \cup E = \Omega, \; O \cap E = \varnothing, \; O \cap S = \{1, 3\}\). These are all meaningful things to consider.
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Notation.</i></b> We define the <b>COMPLEMENT</b> of \(A \in \Omega\) as \(\bar{A} = A \setminus \Omega\).

                Events \(A, B\) are <b>DISJOINT</b>, or mutually exclusive, if and only if \(A \cap B = \varnothing\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                We can then use this notation to describe events.

                <b><i>Example 1.</i></b> <i>"Two coins are tossed"</i>. We have an outcome for one coin of \(\{H, T\}\). Therefore, 2 coins would be \(\Omega = \{H, T\}^2 = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}\). We can then define some events:
                <br><br>
                \(E_1 : \) coin 1 heads \(= \{HH, HT\} \subseteq \Omega\) <br>
                \(E_2 : \) coin 1 = coin 2 \(= \{HH, TT\} \subseteq \Omega\) <br>

                <b><i>Example 2.</i></b> <i>"Three dice thrown"</i>. The sample space of one die is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), thus the sample space of 3 dice is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}^3\).
            </p>

            <p>
                When throwing coins of dice simultaneously, one can argue that the order is not distinct, and, for example, \(HT = TH\). However, modelling with this is different than with distinct order, so we will maintain the latter.

                How would we represent the sample space of 5 cards drawn?

                <p>
                    <b><i>Answer 3.</i></b> The sample space of 5 cards could be \(\Omega = C^5\), but that's assuming the cards can duplicate, or are replaced when they are drawn. How, then, do we exclude replacement?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Suppose we have 2 cards drawn instead. We could exclude duplicates by saying \(\Omega = C \times C \setminus \{(x, x) : x \in C\}\), however we now have pairs \((x, y)\) and \((y, x)\), which are the same two cards, just in a different order. If we want to then treat these as the same, we have to further restrict as:

                    \[ \Omega = (C \times C \setminus \{(x, x) : x \in C\}) / R \]
                    \[ \textrm{where } R : (x, y) R (y, x) \; \forall x, y \in C.\]

                    This is already pretty horribly complex, but perhaps we can simplify this? Instead of looking at cartesian products, we can look at <i>cardinalities</i>, and the fact that sets are unordered, and thus we can simplify to:

                    \[\Omega = \{A \subseteq C : |A| = 2\}.\]
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, logically, for five cards, the sample space is:

                    \[\Omega = \{A \subseteq C : |A| = 5\}.\]

            <p>
                For example, if \(S = \{a, b, c\}\), an arrangement of length 2 \(\textrm{Arr}(s, 2) = ab, ba, bc, cb, ac, ca\). 
                <br><br>

                If we say that arrangements \(a_1, a_2\) are related by \(a_1 \sim a_2\) if the contents of \(a_1, a_2\) are the same. Thus, the equivalence classes of \(\sim\) are combinations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There are \(k\) pairings for length \(k\) equivalence classes, so
                \[|\textrm{Comb}(S, k)| = |\textrm{Arr}(S, k)| / k! = \frac{n(n-1)...(n-k+1)}{k!}\]
                \[= \frac{n(n-1)...(n-k+1)(n-k)(n-k-1)...1}{k! (n-k)(n-k-1)...1} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n\choose k}\]

                    Let \(F\) be a flush. What is \(P(F)\)? Well, if we say that \(F = F_{\spadesuit} \cup F_{\clubsuit} \cup F_{\diamondsuit} \cup F_{\heartsuit}\), then 
                    \[P(F) = P(F_{\spadesuit}) \cup P(F_{\clubsuit}) \cup P(F_{\diamondsuit}) \cup P(F_{\heartsuit}) = 4P(F_{\heartsuit})\]
                    since each \(F_i\) has the same probability.
                    <br><br>
                    We now want all \(A \subseteq C : |A| = 5, A \subseteq \textrm{Hearts}\). \(\textrm{Hearts} = \{\heartsuit\} \times \{A, 2, 3, ..., K\}\). Thus,

                    \begin{align}
                        F_\heartsuit &= \{\textrm{All } A \subseteq \textrm{Hearts} : |A| = 5\} \\
                        \implies P(F_\heartsuit) &= P(\{\omega\}) |F_\heartsuit| = \frac{1}{|\Omega|} \cdot |F_\heartsuit| \\
                        \implies P(F) &= \frac{4|F_\heartsuit|}{|\Omega|}
                    \end{align}

                    <b><i>Answer 9.</i></b> Let's first of all try define a probability space, \((\Omega, 2^\Omega, P)\). 
                    <br><br>
                    \(\Omega\) is the set of all zoggles ever. 
                    <br><br>
                    For a random zoggle \(z \in \Omega\), \(F_i\) denotes the event that the zoggle comes from factory \(i\). We can also say \(F_1 \cup F_2 = \Omega\) and \(F_1 \cap F_2 = \varnothing\).
                    <br><br>
                    Let \(D\) be the set of defective zoggles, then we know that \(P(D | F_1) = 0.2\) and \(P(D | F_2) = 0.05\).

                    \[P(\bar{D}) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P(D |F_1)P(F_1) - P(D|F_2)P(F_2)\]

                    We now need to know \(P(F_1), P(F_2)\). \(P(F_1) + P(F_2) = 1\), and we know that a random zoggle is twice as likely to come from 1 than 2, so \(P(F_1) = 2P(F_2)\), thus \(P(F_1) = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(P(F_2) = \frac{1}{3}\). Thus substituting,

                    \begin{align}
                    P(\bar{D}) &= 1 - 0.2 (\frac{2}{3}) - 0.05 (\frac{1}{3}) \\
                    &= \frac{3 - 0.4 - 0.05}{3} = \frac{2.55}{3} = 0.85.
                    \end{align}

                <p>
                    For part (2), we want to find out \(P(F_1 | D)\).

                    We know \(1 - P(\bar{D})\), but what about \(P(F_1 \cap D)\)? Well, we know that \(P(D | F_1) = 0.2\), thus

                    \begin{align}
                        P(D | F_1) = 0.2 &= \frac{P(D \cap F_1)}{P(F_1)} \\
                        P(D \cap F_1) &= P(D | F_1) P(F_1) \\
                        \therefore P(F_1 | D) &= \frac{P(D | F_1) P(F_1)}{1 - P(\bar{D})} \\

                Let's now talk about independent events. We've talked about conditional probability, \(P(A | B)\). When does the equality \(P(A | B) = P(A)\) hold?
            </p>

            <p>
                What this asserts is that
                \[\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = P(A) \implies P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)\]
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Definition.</i></b> Events \(A, B \in 2^\Omega\) are <b>INDEPENDENT</b> if they satisfy the equation \(P(A \cap B\) = P(A)P(B).
            </p>

            <p>
                Say we had a fair coin and toss it twice, the outcome of one toss is independent of the other. We can easily come up with the probability values for the sample space of that experiment; 0.25 each result.
            </p>

            <p>
                However in more complex systems it may be incredibly hard to assign probabilities straight away, and in this case it would be more meaningful to look at two independent events from the definition of independence, rather than working backwards. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If we had a loaded coin with \(P(H) = 0.4, P(T) = 0.6\), and toss it twice (\(A, B\)) then it is more prudent to consider something like \(P(TT) = P(A)P(B) = 0.6^2\) in this case.

                If we talk about bernoulli distribution, \(X ~ \textrm{Ber}(p)\) (another notation), this is the same as saying \(X \sim B(1, p)\) (notation for binomial).

                A benefit of talking about distributions over individual events is that instead of coming up with individual sample spaces, what we're interested in is something that abstracts away the sample space. If we have a random variable with a particular distribution it doesn't entirely matter what the specifics of the sample space are. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to look at something called the "expectation" of random variables. 
                <br><br>
                Suppose we have a prob. space \((\Omega, 2^\Omega, P)\) and a random var \(X : \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}\). Suppose \(X\) only takes values \(0, 1, 2, 3\) (this would be the range of X).
                <br><br>
                The expectation of X, \(EX = \sum_{i=0}^{3} i P(X=i)\).
            </p>

            <p>
                This is almost like a weighted average. If in the previous example \(X\) has a uniform distribution, then \(EX\) is simply an average of the four possible values.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course more often than not, the probabilities of different values are different. 
            </p>

            <p class="blue">
                <b><i>Definition.</i></b> More generally, if the range of a random var \(X = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), then the <b>EXPECTATION</b> of X,

                Or, more implicitly as \(EX = \sum_{k} k P(X = k)\).

                If the range of X is infinitely countable, then we can use a similar definition with some caveats, but if the range of X is uncountable, then it gets more complicated.

                    <b><i>Answer 14.</i></b> We can consider the prob. state \((\Omega, 2^\Omega, P)\). Let \(\Omega = \{0, 1, 2, ..., 36\}\), \(\textrm{Black} = \{1, 2, ..., 18\}\), and \(\textrm{Red} = \{19, 20, ..., 36\}\). \(P(\{\omega\} = \frac{1}{37} \; \forall \omega \in \Omega\).

                    However, we can do something simpler. Note that our black and red events are not necessarily accurate or representative - the numbers for example are wrong.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps a better space would be \((\Omega', 2^{\Omega'}, P')\) where \(\Omega' = {r, b, 0}\) (red, black, zero). The probabilities thus are no longer uniform, and \(P'(r) = P'(b) = \frac{18}{37}\), and \(P(0) = \frac{1}{37}\).

                    \begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline 0.1 & 0.2 \\ \hline 0.3 & 0.4 \\ \hline  \end{array}
                    Our probability space is \(\Omega, 2^\Omega, P\), and we will define a random value X such that

                    \[X(\omega) = \begin{cases} 0 &\textrm{if top row} \\
                            1 &\textrm{if bottom row} \end{cases}
                    \]

                    And we will define a second random variable Y such that

                            1 &\textrm{if right column} \end{cases}
                    \]

                    Note that these are bernoulli variables. \(P(X = 1) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 7\), whilst \(P(Y = 1) = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6\), thus \(X \sim B(1, 0,7)\) and \(Y \sim B(1, 0.6)\). Let \(Z = X + Y\), what is Z?

                    Z is also a random variable \(Z : \Omega \longrightarrow \{0, 1, 2\}\). Now what is the expectation for Z? Well, we can compute this as 

                    \[E[Z] = 0 \cdot 0.1 + 1 \cdot 0.2 + 1 \cdot 0.3 + 2 \cdot 0.4 = 1.3 \]

                    Is this significant? Well, \(E[X] = 0.7, E[Y] = 0.6\) (we know since they're both bernoulli), and it seems that \(E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]\).

                <p>
                    Let's look at \(E[X + Y]\). This is just \(0.1(0 + 0) + 0.2(0+1) + 0.3(1+0) + 0.4(1+1)\). In the brackets we have sums \((a + b)\), where \(a\) is the value of X and \(b\) is the corresponding value of Y in that case. Thus, we can separate this into \((0 \cdot 0.1 + 0 \cdot 0.2 + 1 \cdot 0.3 + 1 \cdot 0.4) + (0 \cdot 0.1 + 1 \cdot 0.2 + 0 \cdot 0.3 + 1 \cdot 0.4)\), which is nothing but \(E[X] + E[Y]\).

                    ote that \(X, Y\) still work the same way. \(E[X] = 0.2, \; E[Y] = 0.6\). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now let us consider \(XY\). Note that \(XY = 1\) if and only if \(X = Y = 1\), which means \(E[XY] = 0.12\). In this case, \(E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]\)
                </p>

                <p>
                    This only happens because the values of the new grid were chosen systematically. Note that columns 1 and 2 have a total probability of 0.4 and 0.6 respectively, and rows 1 and 2 have a total probability of 0.8 and 0.2 respectively. The probability of each grid is just the product of the respective row and column probabilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a situation where X and Y are <i>independent</i> random variables. <i style="font-size: 8pt;">Left undiscussed.</i>

                While \(E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]\) is always true, \(E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]\) is <b>not</b> always true.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's now look back at \(X \sim B(n, p)\). Basically, X is the sum of successive bernoulli trials, so we \(X = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n\) where \(X_i\) are individual "tries" out of \(n\) total. Thus,

                \[EX = EX_1 + EX_2 + ... + EX_n = p + p + ... + p = np. \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us now talk about functions of random variables. Suppose a prob. space \((\Omega, 2^\Omega, P)\), a random variable \(X\), and a function \(g\), such that
                \begin{align}
                X &: \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
                g &: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}
                \end{align}
                Particularly, functions \(g\) that are like \(g(x) = x^2\), \(g(x) = x^3\).
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, we want to look at whether or not we can compute \(E[g(X)]\). We can see that \(g(X) = g \circ X\) thus \(g : \Omega \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}\), and so \(g\) is also a random variable. So we can say
                \[ E[g(X)] = \sum_{k} kP(g(X) = k) = \sum_{a} g(a)P[X=a]\]
            </p>

            <p>
                In particular, expectations of the form \(E[X^{k}]\) for a \(k \in \mathbb{Z}^+\) is called the <b>\(k\)<sup>th</sup> moment</b> of \(X\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Another, suppose \(m = EX\) (\(m\) is real). Consider a function \(g: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} : g(x) = (x-m)^2\). Then,
                \[E[g(X)] = E[X-m]^2 = E[X - EX]^2 = \sigma^2 = \textrm{ variance of } x\]
                This measures how far away values of \(X\) are from its expectation. Typically standard deviation, \(\sigma\) is used instead. Stdev is in the same units as the original measurement.

                    <b><i>Proof.</i></b> For a special case, assume the range of X is finite. Thus
                    \[\exists v_1, v_2, ... , v_n \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} : \sum_{i = 1}^{n} P(X = v_i) = 1.\]
                    Then,
                    \[EX = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i v_i.\]
                    Let's then split up these \(v\)s, such that some are strictly less than some value \(a\), and all others are greater than or equal to \(a\). Let's look at the sets \(S = \{i : v_i < a\}\) and \(T = \{i : v_i \geq a\}\). Then,
                    \[EX = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i v_i = \sum_{i \in S} p_i v_i + \sum_{i \in T} p_i v_i\]
                    Both \(p_i, v_i \geq 0\), thus we can just drop the first term of the sum and replace with a greater than or equal to sign, since it is not negative. Thus,
                    \[EX = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i v_i \geq \sum_{i \in T} p_i v_i.\]
                    In the second term, all the values are at least \(a\), and therefore
                    \[\sum_{i \in T} p_i v_i \geq \sum p_i a = a \sum_{i \in T} p_i = aP(X \geq a).\]
                    \[\textrm{Hence } EX \geq aP(X \geq a) \implies P(X \geq a) \le \frac{EX}{a}.\]

            <p>
                <i>Note: this is mostly wacky philosophy; if you don't have time don't read this.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                Why do we include \((\Omega, 2^\Omega, P)\)? Mostly, the space of events. We have been using \(2^\Omega\) all the time, but why this specific set?
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider we have an experiment, which can yield the values \([0, 1)\), and let's say all numbers are equally likely. How would probabilities be defined for this?
            </p>

            <p>
                We have the constraint \(P(x) = P(y) \; \forall x, y, \in [0, 1)\). What does P be? If we have <i>any</i> \(P(x) > 0\), we can just add together \(\frac{1}{P(x)}\) events, and then have a probability greater than 1, which can't happen. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So the only logical choice is \(P(x) = 0 \; \forall x \in [0, 1)\). However, now when we take an event (e.g. \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\)), we can no longer say that it is the sum of every elementary outcome, since every elementary outcome has a probability 0. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, we have to rethink our prob. space to only consider certain events \(F \subseteq 2^\Omega\), and thus the space \((\Omega, F, P)\). And we will only define \(P : F \longrightarrow [0, 1]\). <i>The way we actually determine P is not covered</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now we want to go deep, and ask what is a random number? Randomness we can say is intrinsic to the experiment, and not necessarily to the outcome. One way we could define this is that we could take an experiment, and when we perform it an increasing number of times, \(\frac{\textrm{Successful trials}}{\textrm{trials}} \longrightarrow a \in \mathbb{R}\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course in certain cases this is not so clear cut, where we cannot assign a result via experimentation, and we get uncertainty, probability based on belief. For example, I <i>think</i> there'll be a 0.25 chance of rain, but a 0.75 chance of a clear sky. However if I get a contextual clue that suggests rain, my belief may shift to rain. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If we perform an experiment many times, and get a sequence of results HTTHHTHT..., another question one can have is whether this sequence of results is random. Is HHHHHH... 100 times more or less random than HTHTTTHTTHHH...? This is part of a study called algorithmic statistics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, related to randomness we have <i>pseudorandomness</i>, which are heavily used in computer science. The idea of pseudorandomness is that <i>randomness is a relative notion</i>. If you see me flip a coin, and it lands on heads, you may think it's random. However, pretend you're some sort of superhero level analytical genius, and can analyse and predict the motion of the coin as it flies, then you will have already known it will land on heads before it heads. Then, it's not really as random. So it depends on the observer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The same idea is with pseudorandomness: they suffice as random for the observer, however are actually predetermined.
