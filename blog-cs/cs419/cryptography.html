### Background 

Quantum cryptography takes advantage of non-orthogonal states to encode information. The receiver can thus not read message reliably, and furthermore any reading will destroy the message. 

This may be inconvenient for the sender and receiver, but much more for an eavesdropper, Eve (E).

First, we talk about classical systems.

***Secret Sharing*.** The most primitive ciphers are like the caesar cipher. For it to work, the sender and receiver must pre-share an agreed secret, the permutation to un-transform the ciphertext. This is *symmetric* encryption.

The problem with a lot of these systems is that they can be cracked, whether easily (e.g. caesar) or not. Only the **one time pad** is provably secure. Furthermore, a secret key must always be shared, which could be intercepted.

***Public Key Cryptography.*** Using *asymmetric* public private key pairs to encrypt and decrypt data.

There are many different schemes, such as RSA, but they all rely on unproved assumptions about computational hardness (i.e. $P \neq NP$), which could (but probably won't) be disproved, or skirted by using quantum computing f\_ckery.

#### The One-time Pad.

Let the message be a bitstring M of length $n$. 

Encryption/decryption requires A and B to share a private key K, also of length $n$, known **only** to them.

- A encrypts by adding K to M bitwise mod 2 (i.e. XOR). The ciphertext $C = K \oplus M$ 
- Be decrypts by doing the exact same thing. 

If K is *uniformly random*, then C is also random, and an eavesdropper seeing C would get no useful information. 

However, K must only ever be used **once**, else it could be broken. If we have two $C_1 = M_1 \oplus K$ and $C_2 \oplus K$, then an eavesdropper can do $C_1 \oplus C_2 = M_1 \oplus M_2$ and get information.

Further to this, we have to send the key in the first place.

### Quantum Key Distribution

Methods to send a key in a quantumly secure manner.

Suppose A, B are distantly separated in space, and can communicate quantumly and classically. There is an eavesdropper E who can read and access both these channels.

For quantum transmissions, we have:
$$
\begin{matrix}
	\e{\psi_{00}} = \0 & \e{\psi_{01}} = \e+ \\\\
	\e{\psi_{10}} = \1 & \e{\psi_{11}} = \e- 
\end{matrix}
$$
Given over two orth-norm basis $B_0 = \0, \1$ the Z eigenbasis, and $B_1 = \e+, \e-$ the X eigenbasis, which are called **mutually unbiased bases**.

Let bit value 0 be encoded in one of $\0, \e+$, and a 1 be encoded in one of $\1, \e-$. This means $\e{\psi_{ij}}$ has a bit value $i$ in basis $B_j$.

***Mutually Unbiased Bases.*** (MUB) A set of MUB on $\bb{C}^d$ is a set of orthnorm bases s.t. any vector of a basis is an **equally weighted superposition** of vectors in any other basis:
$$
|\ip{e_i}{f_j}|^2 = \frac{1}{d} \pod{\forall i, j \in \{\e{e_i}, \e{f_j}\}}
$$ 

I.e. $\0, \1$ are both equal weighted probabilities of the plus-minus basis, and vice versa.

There are a couple things about $N$ the max number of MUBs in dimension $d$:
- $d=2 \implies N = 3$ being the Z, X, Y eigenbases.
- For any $d$ that is **prime**, $N = d+1$ 
- For any $d$ that is **not** prime, we only know a bound for N, that is if $d = p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} .. p_k^{n_k} \pod{p_1 \lt p_2 \lt \cdots \lt p_k}$ breaks down into these prime factors with these powers, $p_1^{n_1} +1 \leq N \leq d_1$.

#### BB84 Protocol

A quantum key distribution QKD protocol.

<s-side>


【1】A generates 2 random uniform strings uniformly of length n:
$$
\begin{matrix}
	X = x_1 x_2 .. x_n & Y = y_1 y_2 .. y_n
\end{matrix}
$$
Then prepares n qbit states
$$ \e{\psi_{x_1y_1}} .. \e{\psi_{x_ny_n}} $$ 

And sends these to B in order. *(Conjugate coding)*

</s-side>
<p></p>
<s-side>

【2】When B receives n qbits, they may not be in the states $\e{\psi_{x_iy_i}}$, perhaps due to channel noise, or due to eavesdropping and tampering. 

*Firstly.* Assume transmission is perfect, B receives everything as-is. 

B generates a random uniform string $ Y' = y_1' y_2' .. y_n'$ and measures each qbit $i$ in basis $B_{y'_i}$ to get $X' = x_1'..x_n'$ 

> $Y'$ is B's guess at A's encoding basis Y. 

*Note:* If B is correct $y_i' = y_i \implies x_i' = x_i$. If B is incorrect $y_i' \neq y_i$ then $x_i'$ has **no correlation** to $x_i$.

$y_i' = y_i$ happens with probability 0.5.

</s-side>
<p></p>
<s-side>

【3】A and B *publicly reveal* and compare their basis strings Y and Y' (but keep secret Xs).

They both discard all bits $x_i, x_i'$ where the basis bits do not match, leaving shorter strings of *expected* length $\frac n2 : \tilde X , \tilde X'$

Under the assumption of perfect transfer, then these bits provide the desired secret key. 

**However** there is always noise and there may be eavesdropping, and so there are 2 more steps to correct for this.

</s-side>
<p></p>
<s-side>

【4】(**Information reconciliation**) A and B want to estimate the bit error rate BER = $\rm{count}(\tilde X' \neq \tilde X)$.

They publicly compare a **subset** of Xs, at pre-agreed random positions. This can be as much as half. Then, all revealed bits are **discarded**.

They assume the remaining bits have the same *proportional error* <span class="grey">but at unknown positions</span>. 

They want to correct these errors without sacrificing too many key bits, and can be done if BER not too large.

</s-side>
<p></p>

<s-side>

【5】(**Privacy amplification**) are classical methods (not explained) for improving the quality of the key. A and B can do this, also using an estimation of the amount of information E has, via the BER.

</s-side>

There are many possible eavesdropping strategies for E. Such as 

- **Intercept and resend attack** Intercept each qbit separately, measures it in a pre-determined basis, and sends the post measurement state, or try to reconstruct the qbit from her measurement.
- **General Coherent Attack** With a "large quantum probe" unitarily interact (and entangle with) each passing bit, so E has a set of entangled bits (the "probe") which she could measure to obtain possibly joint info -- can even do this after sending and agreement.

-----

***Intercept and Resend.*** Assume quantum channel has no noise, but E intercepts each qbit and measures it in the **breidbart basis** ($\frac\pi8$ basis):

\begin{align}
	\e{\alpha_0} &= \cos \frac\pi8 \0 + \sin \frac\pi 8 \1\\\\
	\e{\alpha_1} &= \cos \frac\pi 8 \0 - \sin \frac\pi 8 \1
\end{align}

This is a basis angled just between computational and conjugate, at 22.5 degrees offset, which is the best for getting information.

We can work out that in every single case, E's probability of measuring A's bit correctly is 
$$ \cos^2 \frac\pi 8 = \frac{1 + \frac 1 {\sqrt 2}}{2} \approx 0.85 $$ 

Now the bit error rate, we have to analyse the probability of getting a *wrong* outcome case by case. This is usually done in a probability tree but I don't want to draw it so more $\TeX$:

$$
\0 \overset{|\ip{\alpha_0}{0}|^2}{\underset{\cos^2}\lra} \e{\alpha_0} \overset{|\ip{\alpha_0}{1}|^2}{\underset{\sin^2}\lra} \1 
$$
$$
\0 \overset{|\ip{\alpha_1}{0}|^2}{\underset{\cos^2}\lra} \e{\alpha_1} \overset{|\ip{\alpha_1}{1}|^2}{\underset{\sin^2}\lra} \1 
$$

Where the left is what A sends, the middle is what E resends, and the right is what B measures (wrong result only). Calculating this we have 
$$P(\rm{wrong}) = \cos^2\sin^2 + \sin^2\cos^2 = 2\sin^2\cos^2 = \frac12 (4\cos^2\sin^2) = \frac12 (2\sin\cos)^2$$
$$= \frac12 \sin^2(\frac\pi4) = \frac14$$
For the case of a missent $\0$. 

Repeating this for all the other three cases, we get $\frac14$ each time, leading to an average BER of $\frac14$.

-----

***Information Reconciliation.*** Suppose there is already some secret key established, but due to noise (or spying) there is some BER (which we have estimated).

So:
- Apply a "random public permutation" to both strings
	- to randomise positions of errors -- both sides must agree on this permutation 
- A and B breaks their strings into blocks of suitable lengths (based on BER) : unlikely each block has 2 errors 
- Compute *bit parity* for each block and announce 
	- Blocks with agreeing parity are tentatively accepted correct.
- Blocks with disagreeing parities must have odd number of errors (likely 1)
	- Break each block in half, and repeat above until offending block is 1 bit long 
	- B corrects that bit 
- Repeat the above as many times as needed to gradually reduce BER 

> Since parity is public, more info is leaked to E. However for blocks of length $k$, only $\log_2 k$ halvings, so exponentially less information is leaked.


------

***Privacy Amplification.***

Ex. A and B share 3 bit string $x_1 x_2 x_3$, and suppose E knows only 1 bit of this bitstring.

<s-side>

***Fact.*** If E knows bit $x$, not $y$, then $x \oplus y$ is uniformly random for E. 

More generally, if E knows some bit, but not all, then there is no knowledge of parity. 

</s-side>

Consider 2 bit strings $y_1 y_2:$ 

$$ \begin{matrix}
	y_1 = x_1 \oplus x_3  & y_2 = x_2 \oplus x_3
\end{matrix} $$ 

Then the outcomes can be:

x | 000 | 001 | 010 | 011 | 100 | 101 | 110 | 111 
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
y | 00 | 11 | 01 | 10 | 10 | 01 | 11 | 00

For any fixed value of any $x_1$, the corresponding $y$ outcomes are always uniform.

**These can't be arbitrarily picked, as they must be uniform depending on E's knowledge.** 

We can represent the above operation in a matrix: 

\begin{align}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		y_1 \\\\ y_2
	\end{bmatrix} &= \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1
	\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
		x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 
	\end{bmatrix} \\\\ 
	y &= Gx
\end{align}

> Rows of $G$ denote subsets of bits for parity sums. Generally, 

<b-blue>

***Thm.*** If E knows only $k/n$ bits, then the $m \times n \pod{m \lt n}$ matrix G will produce secret $y$s **if and only if** the minimum "hamming weight" of the code generated by G is bigger than k.

There is always a G that can generate a secret.

</b-blue>

- *Code:* representation of linear subspace of $(\bb{Z}_2)^n$, i.e. the span of k basis codewords in (that) is given by rows of G 
- *Minimum weight of code:* The least hamming weight of any code word $c \in C$ 
- *Hamming distance:* of two codewords $c_1, c_2 \in C$, is essentially `np.sum(c_1 != c_2)`.

**Universal hashing:** given an $n$ bit string, choose an $m \lt n$ and random boolean matrix $G$, then with high probability, E will have no information about the string $y = Gx$.

### Quantum Banknotes

A quantum banknote is a banknote with a printed serial number, which is an N bit string (publicly visible), as well as N qbits embedded within (which are stable). 

For each banknote, the bank will have an N bit secret "basis" string.

When the note is manufactured, the serial number is encoded into **BB84 bases** according to the basis string.

When the note is returned / checked later, the bank can test the authenticity of the note by looking up the secret, and measuring the serial number in the basis given. The note is accepted *only if* the serial number matches exactly. 

- A genuine banknote passes the test and **remains** genuine (since the qbit doesnt change if you measure it in the right basis.)

A counterfeiter C wants to make notes that pass the test.

Consider the $k$th bit. We want to ask: what is the maximum probability that the counterfeiter can determine the $k$th basis by measuring that bit?

C can see the $k$th serial number, and knows that it is in $\0, \e+p$ for a 0 bit, and $\1, \e-$ for a 1 bit. 

To determine the basis, C must determine between two **equally probable** states (their inner product is $\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}$).

With the **Helstrom Holevo bound** we know that the maximum probability of successs is UB by 
$$
\frac{1 + \sin \frac{\pi}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}}{2} \approx 0.8535
$$
So C gets a wrong result with $p \approx 0.1465$.

Now C use uses this result to set a basis string for a new fake banknote with the same serial number. If the note is subsequently inspected by the bank, the probability that bit $k$ 
- has the correct basis and passes is 0.8535 
- has the wrong basis and passes is 0.5 &times; 0.1465
- has the wrong basis and fails is 0.5 &times; 0.1465

And so one bit would pass with $p \approx 0.926$, and so we just need to increase the number of bits to make this probability arbitrarily small.
- For 100 bits, the probability of full success is $0.926^{100} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-4}$
