### Quantum States as Information Carriers

A qbit is the simplest system that can reliably encode a classical bit.

Information is proportional to the number of distinguishable states of a physical system.
- Classically, any two different states are distinguishable (trivially)
- Quantumly, states are **distinguishable** $\iff$ they are **orthogonal**
	- So if you take $\0$ and $\e+$, and a black box that outputs any one of the two, it is **impossible** to certainly identify which one it is.

Given some quantum information $\e\psi$, we can do 3 basic things:

1. **Ancilla.** Take a fixed known quant-state $\e A$ and adjoin it to our state to get a bigger one: $\e{\tilde{\psi}} = \e\psi \e A$.
2. **Unitary.** Apply a unitary operator $U$ 
3. **Measure.** Take a measurement on all or part of $\e\psi$, thus 
	- Can record result 
	- And based on outcomes choose further steps 
	- Output is generally probabilistic. 

And **any combination of the 3**.


### The No Cloning Theorem

> Quantum information cannot be copied or cloned.

Copying classical information is trivial. To relate it to operators, we can just use a CNOT operator. 

More generally, any copying process has the form
- $(b) (0) (M)$ an information register (with $b$), a blank register (with 0), and an internal machine state $M$ which is in the **Ready** state 
- And goes to $(b) (b) (M_2)$ with the blank register having the copy, and the machine state being $M_b$ post copy (since it can change during copy.)

$$ (b) (0) (M) \lra_{CNOT} (b)(b)(M)$$ 

Quantumly:
- Given some information $\e\psi_A$,
- Copying is a *quantum evolution* process of subsystems $A, B, M$. We want 
$$ \e\psi_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_? \e\psi\_A \e\psi\_B \e{M\_\psi}_M $$
- Where B is the blank register space, and M is any extra space needed, which is initially in ready state $M_0$ independent of $\e\psi_A$. 

<b-blue>

***Theorem.*** **No cloning theorem** (Unitary version)

Let $S$ be any known set of quantum states of system $A$, that contains at least one pair $\e\xi, \e\eta : \e\xi \neq \e\eta$ and they are orthogonal. 

Then there exist **no unitary process** that achieves cloning of all states in $S$. 

</b-blue>

Remarks:
- If $\e\xi = \e\eta$, then there is only one state and it clones fine 
- If $\e\xi \perp \e\eta$, then they can also clone fine (can rotate to $\0, \1$ and apply CX)
	- So $CX \e k \0 = \e k \e k : k = 0,1$, 
	- but $CX(a\0 + b\1)\0 = a\e{00} + \e{11} \neq (a\0 + b\1)(a\0 + b\1)$. 
- No unitary process means no combination of operations above. 

<s-side>

***Proof.*** Let $\e\xi, \e\eta$ be two different non-orth states. Then we require the cloning process to 
$$ \e\xi\_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_U \e\xi_A \e\xi_B \e{M\_\xi}_M $$ 
$$ \e\eta\_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_U \e\eta_A \e\eta_B \e{M\_\eta}_M $$ 

***Note.** Unitary processes preserve inner products.*

Therefore
\begin{align}
	\ip\xi\eta \ip00 \ip{M_0}{M_0} &= \ip\xi\eta \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta}\\\\
	\implies \ip\xi\eta &= \ip\xi\eta \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta}
\end{align}
Since anything inner prod itself = 1 (in normalised vectors).

Since $\e\xi \neq \e\eta$, we know $0 &lt; \ip\xi\eta &lt; 1$, and $0 \leq \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta} \leq 1$ (we don't really care what the machine state is)

Thus 
$$ 1 = \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi} {M_\eta}  $$
Which is a contradiction since neither of the two terms on the right can ever multiply to 1. $\Box$

</s-side>

> However we *can* copy information with a good probability.

### Indistinguishability of Non-Orthogonal States

- *Given.* an unknown state $\e\psi$ of any dimension,
- *Promise.* $\e\psi$ is either $\e{\alpha_0}$ or $\e{\alpha_1}$, which are distinct known states 
- *Problem.* must determine which state $\e\psi$ is 

We know we cannot do this with certainty if $\ip{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1} \neq 0$.

***State Estimation Process.*** 
Given a state $\e\psi$, we can (1) adjoin an ancilla $\e A$, (2) do a unitary, or (3) perform a measurement.

By adjoining $\e A$ we can change the problem to discriminating against $\e{\alpha_0}\e A$ against $\e{\alpha_1}\e A$, **but** the inner product remains the same.

*The process.* Let us have a state estimation process $M_1$. We do a unitary U, followed by measurements $\Pi_0, \Pi_1$, i.e. a "rotated measurement", where the new projectors are:
$$
\tilde\Pi_i = U^\dagger \Pi_i U \pod{i=0,1}
$$
For any $\e\xi: P_{M_1}(i) = (\b{\xi}U^\dagger) \Pi_i (U\e\xi)) = \langle \xi | U^\dagger \Pi_i  U | \xi \rangle$, which becomes $\ip{\xi}{\tilde\Pi_i | \xi}$, so our rotated mnt is just a single mnt in reality.

Some measurements are better than others at giving a correct measurement -- introduce a *figure of merit*, a **success probability** $P_s$.

We assume no prior information about the state -- prior probabilities are $\frac{1}{2}$, so
$$
P_s = \frac{1}{2}P(0|\alpha_0) + \frac{1}{2}P(1|\alpha_1)
$$
Which by the born rule becomes
$$
P_s = \frac{1}{2} (\ip{\alpha_0}{\Pi_0|\alpha_0}+\ip{\alpha_1}{\Pi_1|\alpha_1})
$$
which since $\Pi_1 = I - \Pi_0$ we can write in terms of successful and mistaken inference of alpha-0:
$$
\begin{align*}
P_s &=  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}(\ip{\alpha_0}{\Pi_0|\alpha_0} - \ip{\alpha_1}{\Pi_0|\alpha_1})\\\\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\Tr(\Pi_0)(\e{\alpha_0}\b{\alpha_0} - \e{\alpha_1}\b{\alpha_1}) \pod{\dagger}
\end{align*}
$$
> Tr is the trace, the sum of diagonal elements.

And we want to find an optimal Pi-zero projector. Let $D = \e{\alpha_0}\b{\alpha_0} - \e{\alpha_1}\b{\alpha_1}$, we know D is hermitian, thus its eigenvalues are real. Therefore it has a complete eigenbasis of orthonormal states. 

Let $\e\beta : \e\beta \perp \e{\alpha_0}, \e{\alpha_1}$, and so
$$
D\e\beta = \e{\alpha_0}\ip{\alpha_0}\beta - \e{\alpha_1}\ip{\alpha_1}\beta = 0
$$
so D only has 2 nonzero eigenvalues. 

The trace of D is zero (the reason is left as an excersise), and so the sum of the eigenvalues is also zero. Let the eigenvalues be $\delta, -\delta$, with eigenstates $\e p, \e m$, and so $D = \delta\e p - \delta\e m$. 

We want to determine delta in terms of the alphas, so we work in subspaces of the two alphas. We need a new basis for each, so 
- Choose $\e{\alpha_0^\perp}$ to be orthnorm to $\e{\alpha_0}$, so $\e{\alpha_0^\perp}, \e{\alpha_0}$ forms a basis.
- *Let* $\e{\alpha_0} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}; \e{\alpha_1} = \begin{bmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_1 \end{bmatrix} = c_0\e{\alpha_0} + c_1 \e{\alpha_0^\perp}$.
Find the new coefficients by taking inner products of each base with the original vector:
- $c_0 = \ip{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1}$, $|c_1| = \sin\theta$, and $|\ip{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1}| = \cos \theta$ for the angle between the two vectors (presumably)
And so 
$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix} c_0 \\\\ c_1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} c_0^* & c_1^* \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
|c_1|^2 & -c_0c_1^* \\\\ -c_1c_0^* & -|c_1|^2
 \end{bmatrix}
$$
We want the eigenvectors, i.e. to solve the characteristic equation $\det(D = \lambda I) = 0$
- From this we get $\lambda = |c_1| = \pm \sin\theta$, and so $\delta = \sin  \theta$.
- Substituting into ($\dagger$)
$$
\begin{align*}
P_s &= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\delta}{2}\Tr(\Pi_0)(\e p \b p - \e m \b m)\\\\
&= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\delta}{2}(\b p \Pi_0 \e p - \b m \Pi_0 \e m)
\end{align*}
$$

For any projector $\Pi$ and arbitrary state $\e\xi$, we have that 
$$0 \leq \b\xi \Pi \e\xi \leq 1$$
And so $P_s$ achieves a maximum value when the LH term in the bracket goes to 1, and RH goes to 0, i.e.
$$
P_s = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\delta}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(1+\sin\theta)
$$
When states are orthogonal, $\sin\theta = 1$, and the success chance is 1. If states are aligned, then success is zero, and somewhere in between etc.

> So how do we find $\Pi_0$?

If this is chosen to be any projection in a subspace that
- contains $\e p \implies \Pi_0 \e p = \e p$
- orthogonal to $\e m \implies \Pi_0 \e m = \e m$
Such a chance is **always possible**, since they are orthogonal, and so the achievable bound 
$$
P_s \leq \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sin\theta).
$$

> This is the *Helstrom Holevo* bound

***Note.*** 
- The ancilla is **never needed**, since only the inner product is relevant.
- If the two alphas are qubit states, we can just work in 2D space
- Optimal discrimination mnt is a **complete** mnt of a quantum observable D. 

<b-blue>

***Theorem.* Helstrom-Holevo Bound**

Given one of two equally likely states $\e{\alpha_0}, \e{\alpha_1}$ with $|\ip{\alpha_0}{\alpha_1}| = \cos \theta$, then the probability of correct identification is bounded **tightly** by
$$P_s \leq \frac{1}{2}(1 + \sin\theta)$$

</b-blue>

Remark: Other disambiguation processes are possible. We could have an **unambiguous discrimination** with three outcome states: 0, 1, fail, where fail occurs when it is neither certainly 0 nor 1.

### No Signalling Principle

***The standard setup.*** 
- We have two people, Alice and Bob, who are distantly separated in space. <span class="grey">This is an arbitary distance, and can be quite close or very far</span>
- Each hold a local quantum system A, B respectively.
- Initially, A, B is in the same (possibly entangled) quantum state. 
- Each can apply local actions on their own systems.

***The issue.*** Suppose Alice performs a local measurement on A. 

The born rule says that for each measurement outcome $k$ on A, the state at B will "instantaneously change" to reflect measurement collapse to a post-mnt state $\e{\beta_k}$.

Can B notice this change by only local actions? i.e. can we have faster-than-light information panel?

(No.)

Consider local operations on composite system $\e\psi_{AB}$. Let $H_A, H_B$ be the state space of A and B, i.e. $H_{AB} = H_A \tens H_B$. 

【Local ancilla】 Alice and bob can adjoin local ancilla spaces $A', B'$ to enlarge the dimension of their local systems.

【Local unitary】 Alice can perform a local unitary on her own half respective to B's system:
$$
\begin{matrix}U_A \tens I_B \pod{\rm{Alice}} & I_A \tens U_B \pod{\rm{Bob}}\end{matrix}
$$
**Note** that unitary operators on disjoint subsystems always commute: i.e. they can be done in any order $\lra U_A \tens U_B$. 

【Local measurement】 Say Alice performs mnt on A with some orth subspaces $E_a$, and projectors $\Pi_a$. She will have outcomes $a$. Note that the space is made as 
$$
H_A  = \oplus_a E_a
$$
like before. 

A full span measurement effect is represented by the subspace $E_a \tens H_B$, and is gotten by projector $\Pi_a \tens I_B$ over $H_{AB}$.

Similarly Bob can do the same for B, to get subspaces $F_b$ and outcomes $b$ by projectors $\Pi_b$.

By the born rule we can obtain a joint prob dist $P(a,b)$ by performing the corresponding measurements independently and getting subspace $E_a \tens F_b$, and these projectors commute.

<b-blue>

***Theorem.* No signalling principle**

Suppose Alice and Bob have access to local states A, B and a joint quantum system $\e\psi_{AB}$. Alice **cannot** convey any information to Bob by performing local operations.

i.e. no local action by Alice can change the output probability of any local quantum process of Bob

</b-blue>

<s-side>

***Proof.*** Consider a case when bob performs a complete mnt on B, w.r.t bases $\{\e b_B\}$ and outcomes $b$. 

Firstly, alice does nothing, and the state can be represented using this basis as
$$
\e\psi_{AB}  = \sum\limits_{\forall b} \e{\xi_b}_A \e b \pod{\dagger}
$$
For some xi vector where $\e{\xi\_b}\_A = \ip{b}{\psi}\_{AB}$ -- just converting bases. These are the *conditioned states of A given b*. By the born rule $P(b) = \ip{\xi\_b}{\xi\_b}$.

Now suppose alice does complete measurement w.r.t bases $\{\e a \}$ and outcomes $a$, projectors $\Pi_a = \e{a}\b{a}$. In $(\dagger)$ this becomes
$$
P(a) = \left\lVert \sum\limits\_{\forall b} (\Pi_a \e{\xi\_b}\_A) \e b\_B \right\rVert
$$
And the post measurement state is
$$
\e{\psi\_a}\_{AB} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{P(a)}}\sum\limits\_{\forall b} (\Pi\_a \e{\xi\_b}\_A) \e b\_B \pod{\ddagger}
$$

Suppose alice obtains $a$, and now bob does a measurement. $P(b|a)$ is the l2 squared of the projection of $(\ddagger)$ onto $\e b$:
$$P(b|a) = \lVert \Pi_a \e{\xi_b} \rVert^2 = \b{\xi_b} \Pi_a \e{\xi_b}$$
Therefore
$$
P(b) = \sum\limits_{\forall a}\b{\xi_b} \Pi_a \e{\xi_b} = \b{\xi_b} \sum\limits_{\forall a} \Pi_a \e{\xi_b} = \b{\xi_b} I\e{\xi_b}
$$
Which is just $\ip{\xi_b}{\xi_b} = P(b)$, so no matter what alice does, bob's measurement probabilities doesn't change. $\Box$

</s-side>

Remarks:
- This generalises to incomplete measurements -- if you sum over the projectors it gives the identity
- Unitary preserve inner products and so local unitaries won't work either
- Therefore there is no FTL transfer.

### Quantum Dense Coding 

We know that a single qbit can only reliably encode one bit of information. i.e. you can only send one bit per qbit... right?

Well with some quantum f\_ckery we can send more information, if the qbit being sent is already entangled with a qbit at the receiver. This lets us send **2 bits** of information per qibt.

<b-blue>

***Def.*** **Bell states**, or bell basis, is defined by the following: 

\begin{align*}
\e{\phi^+} &=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\e{00} + \e{11})\\\\
\e{\phi^-} &=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\e{00} - \e{11})\\\\
\e{\psi^+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\e{01}+\e{10})\\\\
\e{\psi^-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\e{01}-\e{10})
\end{align*}

These states are orthogonal, and the bell basis for 2 qbits are give by these four:
$$
\\{ \e{\phi^+}, \e{\phi^-}, \e{\psi^+}, \e{\psi^-} \\}
$$

</b-blue>

Notably, whereas the 2 qbit computational basis (00 01 10 11) are all product states, these are all **entangled**. Also,

\begin{align}
\e{\phi^+} &= I \tens I \e{\phi^+} \\\\	
\e{\phi^-} &= Z \tens I \e{\phi^+} \\\\	
\e{\psi^+} &= X \tens I \e{\phi^+} \\\\	
\e{\psi^+} &= Y \tens I \e{\phi^+} \\\\	
\end{align}

And for any one qbit unitary U:

$$ U \tens I \e{\phi^+} = I \tens U\t \e{\phi^+} $$

We can also make these states by applying operations to the computational basis:

$$
\0\0 \overset{H \tens I}{\lra} \e+\0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\0 + \1)\0 \overset{CX_{12}}{\lra} \e{\phi^+}
$$

This works over the other three states and produces the other three bases.

<s-side>

***The quantum dense coding protocol.*** Let Alice and Bob (A and B) be distantly separated in space, and each has one qbit of the entangled $\e{\psi^+}$ state. A wants to send 2 bits of B, so she does:

1. A applies $I,X,Z,Y$ respectively to her (first) qbit, to make the state $\e{\phi^+}, \e{\phi^-}, \e{\psi^+}, \e{\psi^-}$, which encode messages 00, 01, 10, 11.
2. A sends this qbit to B
3. B does a **bell measurement** on both qbits together.

</s-side>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

***Def.*** A bell measurement is one of four projectors in the bell basis:

\begin{matrix}
	\Pi_0 = \e{\phi^+}\b{\phi^+} & \Pi_2 = \e{\psi^+}\b{\psi^+}  \\\\
	\Pi_4 = \e{\phi^-}\b{\phi^-} & \Pi_3 = \e{\psi^-}\b{\psi^-}
\end{matrix}

</b-blue>

### Quantum Teleportation 

A protocol to send quantum information, in the **LOCC** (local operation and classical communication) paradigm. I.e. A and B can do local quantum operations but can only communicate through classical channels.

Classical channels can mean anything, such as a phone line.

A and B are separated in space, but each have an entangled state $\e{\phi^+}$. 

A has another qbit in some arbitrary state $\e\alpha$, which is possibly unknown, and wants to send this to B without directly sending it over. A cannot identify $\e\alpha$ without destroying it, and the space between A and B is hostile to quantum transfer.

<s-side>

***The protocol.*** A can transfer $\e\alpha$ to B using the entanglement of $\e{\phi^+}$, without anything being passed through space. Let the qbit labels:

- 1: The input qbit $\e\alpha$ (owned by A)
- 2: The first qbit of entangled $\e{\phi^+}$ (owned by A)
- 3: The second qbit of entangled $\e{\phi^+}$ (owned by B)

The initial state is $\e\alpha_1 \e{\phi^+}_{23}$, where $\e\alpha = a\0 + b\1$ for some amplitudes. We have that 
\begin{align}
\e\alpha \e{\phi^+} &= (a\0 + b\1) \tens \frac{1 }{\sqrt{2} } (\e{00} + \e{11}) \\\\
&= \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{000} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{011} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{100} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{111} \pod{\dagger}
\end{align}

We perform the following steps.

1. A applies $CX_{12}$ to 1 and 2.
2. A applies $H$ to 1 
3. A measures both qbits in computational basis, and obtains one of 00, 01, 10, 11

(Note that this is equivalent to a bell measurement on 12)

</s-side>

We can look at the effects of these steps on $(\dagger)$:

\begin{matrix}
	\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{000} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{011} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{100} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{111} \\\\
	\Big\downarrow CX_{12} \\\\
	\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{000} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\e{011} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{110} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\e{101} \\\\
	\Big\downarrow H_1 \\\\
	\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{\0 + \1}{\sqrt{2}})\e{00} + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{\0 + \1}{\sqrt{2}})\e{11} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{\0 - \1}{\sqrt{2}})\e{00} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{\0 - \1}{\sqrt{2}})\e{11} \\\\
	= \\\\
	\frac{1 }{2 } (\e{00}(a\0 + b\1) + \e{01}(a\1 + b\0) + \e{10}(a\0 - b\1) + \e{11}(a\1 - b\0)) \\\\
	= \\\\
	\frac{1}{2} (\e{00}I\e\alpha + \e{01}X\e\alpha+ \e{01}Z\e\alpha+ \e{01}Y\e\alpha)
\end{matrix}

Therefore via the born rule we get 

Outcome | Post measurement state | Probability
-|-|- 
00 | $ \e{00}_{12}\e\alpha_3$  | 0.25
01 | $ \e{01}_{12}X\e\alpha_3$  | 0.25
10 | $ \e{10}_{12}Z\e\alpha_3$  | 0.25
11 | $ \e{11}_{12}Y\e\alpha_3$  | 0.25

I.e. for outcome $\e{ij}$ the post measurement state has transformation $X^jZ^i$ applied. 

<s-side>

A then sends the 2 bit outcome to B, so B knows which state alpha is in.

B applies the back-transform $Z^iX^j$ to his 3 state, and the state becomes just $\e\alpha$. 

</s-side>

Teleportation!

***Quantum Circuit diagram.***

Quantum processes like this can be represented as a circuit diagram with time moving along the x axis:

![teleportation circuit diagram](./qcircuit.png)

Double lines represent classical information transfer.

Remarks:
- After teleportation, A is left, uniformly randomly, with one of the four 2 q-bit states 00, 01, 10, 11. I.e., *no information* is left at A (and consistent with no cloning and no signalling)
- Before A's measurement, B's qbit is half of the $\e{\psi^+}$ state, and we can show that any complete measurement on that would give a random outcome.
- After A's measurement, B's qbit is one of the four results all with 0.25 probability. Any complete measurement would thus result in 0 or 1 with prob 1/2.
- The *physical system* of $\e\alpha$ is not transferred, only the identity/information being reconstructed exactly in a *different* system.
