### Fundamentals and Dirac Notation 

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space, where the vector coefficients are **complex**.


<b-blue>

***Def.*** We write a vector in $V$ as $\k{v} \in V$. This is called a **ket** vector and is a *column* vector.

</b-blue>


Generally we work in 2D vector spaces: $V_2$, with some chosen ortho-normal basis $\\{\k{0}, \k{1}\\}$

***Example.*** Some vector $\k{v}$ can be written as a decomposition of bases:
$$ \k{v} = a \k{0} + b \k{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
	a \\\\ b
\end{bmatrix} \pod{a, b \in \bb{C}} $$ 

<b-blue>

***Def.*** The **conjugate transpose** of vector $\k{v}$ is $\k{v}^\dagger$, and is made by transposing the vector and replacing its coefficients with their complex conjugates. This is a **bra** vector and is a row vector, and we reverse the direction of the brackets.

\begin{align}
	\b{v} = \k{v}^\dagger &= a^* \b{0} + b^* \b{1} \\\\
	&= \begin{bmatrix}
		a^*  & b^*
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

</b-blue>

Let vector $\k{w} = c\k{0} + d \k{1}$.

<b-blue>


The **inner product** of $\k{v}$ and $\k{w}$ is written 
$$ \ip{v}{w} = \k{v}^\dagger \k{w} = \begin{bmatrix}
	a^* & b^*
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
	c \\\\ d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

</b-blue>

We can say that 
- $\ip{0}{1} = 0$ since the bases are ortho-normal,
- $\ip{i}{j} = \delta_{ij}$ for some $\k{i}, \k{j}$


> This is Dirac's "bra-ket" notation, which is just "bracket" without the c.

<b-blue>

***Def.*** The **Tensor product** of vectors (in a fixed basis) is defined as follows:

- Let vector spaces $V$ of dimension $m$, with basis $\k{e_1} \dots \k{e_m}$
- $W$ of dimension $n$ with basis $\k{f_1} \dots \k{f_n}$ 

The **tensor product space** $V \tens W$ has basis
$$ \\{ \k{e_i} \tens \k{e_j} : i = 1\cdots m , j = 1 \cdots n \\}  $$ 

i.e. there are $m \times n$ bases.


A general vector $\k{\xi} \in V \tens W$ is defined 
$$ \k{\xi} = \sum_{i, j} c_{ij} \k{e_i} \tens \k{e_j} $$ 

For coefficients $c_{ij}$ 


Let $\k{\alpha} \in V = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \k{e_i}$, and $\k{\beta} \in W = \sum_{j=1}^n b_j \k{f_j} $.  Then the **tensor product** of two vectors is defined as:

\begin{align}
	 \k{\alpha} \tens \k{\beta} &= \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \k{e_i} \tens \sum_{j=1}^n b_j \k{f_j} \\\\
	 &= \sum_{\forall i, j} a_i b_j \k{e_i} \tens \k{e_j}
\end{align}

</b-blue>

> Whilst this is a rather... recursive definition, when we reach the fundamental bases (i.e. just have numbers) we can just perform the below operation.

***Example.*** Let:

$$\begin{matrix}
	\k{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.1 \\\\ -0.7
	\end{bmatrix} & \k{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.3 \\\\ 0.5
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}$$

Then 

$$ 
\k{a} \tens \k{b} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.1 \\\\ -0.7 
\end{bmatrix} \tens \begin{bmatrix}
	0.3 \\\\ 0.5
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.1 \times 0.3 \\\\
	0.1 \times 0.5 \\\\
	-0.7 \times 0.3 \\\\
	-0.7 \times 0.5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

I.e. everything times everything.

Thus for fundamental bases $V_2 \sim \left\\{ \k{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1\\\\0
\end{bmatrix}, \k{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0\\\\1
\end{bmatrix} \right\\}$, we can get 

$$ 
\k{0} \tens \k{0} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1\\\\0
\end{bmatrix} \tens \begin{bmatrix}
	1\\\\0
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\0
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

And we can get all our other new bases the same way.

### Product and Entangled States

<b-blue>

***Def.*** Any vector $\k{\xi} \in V \tens W$ of the form $\k{\xi} = \k{a}\_{\in V} \tens \k{b}\_{\in W}$ is called a **product vector**.

</b-blue>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

Any vector which is *not* a product vector is an **entangled vector**.

</b-blue>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

***Def.*** The **k-fold tensor product***, denoted $\tens^k V\_2$ or $V^{\tens k}$ is the vector space 

$$ V_2 \tens V_2 \tens \cdots \tens V_2 \pod{k \textrm{ times}}$$

With $2^k$ bases, with each basis being denoted as a k-length bit string. 

Each basis is $\k{i_1} \tens \cdots \tens \k{i_k}$, but because $\tens$ is a bit of a pain it is often written as $\k{i_1}\k{i_2} \cdots \k{i_k}$ or just $\k{i_1i_2 \dots i_k}$.

</b-blue>

***Example.*** Let $\k{v} = 1\k{00} + 1\k{11}$. We claim that this is entangled.

To verify if it is entangled or not, we must demonstrate that it is or is not a product state. I.e. suppose 
$$ \k{v} = (a\k{0} + b\k{1}) \tens (c\k{0} + d\k{1}) $$ 
This resolves to 
$$ ac\k{00} + ad \k{01} + bc \k{10} + bd \k{11} $$ 
We get that $ac = bd = 0$ and $ad = bc = 1$, which is not possible to solve. Thus $\k{v}$ is entangled.


Generally for an arbitrary $\e{v} \in V_2 \tens V_2 = a_{00} \e{00} + a_{01} \e{01} + a_{10} \e{10} + a_{11} \e{11}$, 

$$ \e{v} \rm{ entangled } \iff \det(A) \neq 0 $$ 

Where 

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix}
	a_{00} & a_{01} \\\\ a_{10} & a_{11}
\end{bmatrix} $$

But this is *not true* in higher dimensions.

For general dimensions 

$$ \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^n A_{ij} \e{i} \e{j} \rm{ product vector } \iff \rm{ mat } A \rm{ is rank 1} $$

> Rank is a linear algebra term -- it is the number of columns (or rows, whichever is **smaller** that are linearly independent)

----- 

The inner product on general spaces $V \tens W$ is "induced by inner products on V and W applied slotwise". 

This is to say for product states $\e{a_1}\e{b_1}$ and $\e{a_2}\e{b_2}$, the inner product is 
$$ (\b{b_1}\b{a_1})(\k{a_2}\k{b_2}) \equiv \ip{a_1}{a_2} \ip{b_1}{b_2}.$$

----- 

When vectors come from the same subspaces tensored together, it is important to label which vector belongs to which space.

Tensor product is a commutative operation, so for subspaces $A, B$, we could have $\e{\alpha}_A \e{\beta}_B$ having the bra form $\b{\alpha}_A \b{\beta}_B = \b{\beta}_B \b{\alpha}_A$

	<h2>Quantum Mechanical Principles</h2>
</div>

<div class="cbox">
<div class="md-conv">

### Principle 1 - On Physical States 

<b-blue>

The states of any isolated physical system $S$ are represented by unit vectors in complete vector space $V$, with an inner product $\ip{v}{v} = 1$

$\lra$ Any state is describable by unit vectors.

</b-blue>

***Ex.*** Take the simplest non trivial case of 1 qbit in 2-dimensional $V$.

Take bases $\e{0}, \e{1}$. The general state $\e{\psi} = a\e{0} + b\e{1}$.

$\lra \e\psi$ is a superposition of states $\e{0}, \e{1}$ with **amplitudes** $a, b \in \bb{C}$.
<!-- 我操竟能这样子 -->
<b-blue>

***Def.*** A **Qubit** is a quantum system with a 2D state space *and* a chosen ortho-normal basis labelled $\0, \1$. 

These are also called the $z-$, computational, or standard basis.

</b-blue>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

***Def.*** The **conjugate basis** for a qbit in the orth-norm basis $\0, \1$ is defined as 

\begin{align}
	\e+ &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\0 + \1) \\\\
	\e- &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\0 - \1)
\end{align}

This is rotated 45&deg; from the standard basis.

</b-blue>

</div>

<div class="md-conv">

### Princple 2 - Composite Systems

<b-blue>

Let system $S_1$ have state space $V_A$, $S_2$ have state space $V_B$;

Then the **joint system** $S_1 S_2$ has state space $V_A \tens V_B$.

</b-blue>

***Ex.*** Take $n$ qbits. Their state space is $\tens^n V_2$, with dimension $2^n$.

The standard basis is $2^n$ vectors of $n$ length bit strings $\e{i_1 \cdots i_n}$.

The $n$-bit state is a product state *if* 
- it is a tensor product of $n$ 1-qbit states $$ \e\psi = \e v_1 \e v_2 \cdots \e v_n $$ 
- Otherwise, $\e\psi$ is entangled.


In quantum computing as the number of qbits grow, the state description grows **exponentially**. 

However, for *product* states, the description only grows **linearly**. This describes a classical computing system.

#### Dirac and Linear Maps

Consider linear maps on $V_2$ 

> A linear map, or linear mapping on a 2D space is just a 2D transformation matrix.

Let $\e v = a\0 + b\1$ and $\e w = c\0 + d\1$, the *ket-bra product* gives 
$$ M = \e v \b w = \begin{bmatrix}
	a \\\\ b 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
	c* & d* 
\end{bmatrix}$$ 
$$ = \begin{bmatrix}
	ac* & ad* \\\\ bc* & bd* 
\end{bmatrix} $$ 

This is a **linear map** on $V_2$ that projects a state down. That is to say,

For any vector $\e x = \begin{bmatrix}
	x_0 \\\\ x_1
\end{bmatrix} $,
$$ M \e x = (\e v \b w) \e x = \e v \ip w x $$

It turns into a scaled $\e v$. These are called **rank 1 mappings**.

Given 
\begin{matrix}
	\e 0 \b 0 = \begin{bmatrix}
		1&0 \\\\ 0&0
	\end{bmatrix} &
	\e 0 \b 1 = \begin{bmatrix}
		0&1 \\\\ 0&0
	\end{bmatrix} \\\\ 
	\e 1 \b 0 =\begin{bmatrix}
		0&0 \\\\ 1&0
	\end{bmatrix} &
	\e 1 \b 1 =\begin{bmatrix}
		0&0 \\\\ 0&1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}

We can make any mapping $A$ as a weighted sum of these four. 

> Hopefully that's trivial.

<b-blue>

A **projection operator** is a special case of $M$ (above), with $\e v =\e w$ in any dimensions. And since vectors are normalised, $\ip v v = 1$.

$\Pi_v = \e v \b v$ is an operator projecting onto a 1D subspace spanned by $\e v$. It has these properties:

- $\Pi_v \Pi_v = \e v \b v \e v \b v = \Pi_v$ only.
- $\Pi_v \e v = \e v \b v \e v = \e v$. 
- $\Pi_v \e w = 0$ when $\e w$ is orthogonal to $\e v \pod{\e w \perp \e v} $

</b-blue>


Generally for any d-dimensional subspace E of an n-D space V, where E has basis $\\{ \e e_1 \cdots \e e_d \\}$, 

$$ \Pi_E = \e {e_1} \b {e_1} + \cdots + \e {e_d} \b {e_d} $$ 

is an operator projecting from $V \lra E$.


If $A = \begin{bmatrix}
	a & b \\\\ c & d
\end{bmatrix}, B = \begin{bmatrix}
	p & q \\\\ r & s
\end{bmatrix}$ are linear operators on $V_2$, 

Then $A \tens B : V_2 \tens V_2 \lra V_2 \tens V_2$ is defined by the action on the separate bases:
$$ \e i \e j \mapsto (A\e i)(B\e j)$$ 

This is also true for any general joint vectors.

To actually work out this matrix though, we would get a 4x4 matrix where each of the four quadrants is defined
$$ A \tens B = \begin{bmatrix}
	aB & bB \\\\ cB & dB
\end{bmatrix}. $$ 



</div>

<div class="md-conv">

### Principle 3 - Physical Evolution of Systems


<b-blue>

Any physical finite time evolution of a quantum system is represented by **unitary** linear operators on a vector space of states.

</b-blue>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

***Def.*** **Unitary matrices**: $U$ is unitary 

- **iff** $U^{-1} = U^\dagger$ (conjugate transpose);
- **iff** $U$ maps any orth-norm basis to any other orth-norm set of vectors.
- **iff** its columns or rows form an orth-norm set of vectors.

</b-blue>
<p></p>
<b-blue>

***Def.*** **Partial inner product:** On vectors in $V \tens W$:
- Take any ket $\e v \in V$, this defines a linear map $V \tens W \lra W$, which is the **partial inner product with $\e v$**.
- Which is defined on basis vectors $\e {e_i} \e {f_j} \in V \tens W$, and maps $$ \e {e_i} \e {f_j} \mapsto \ip v {e_i} \e f_j $$

If $V = W$, then we must specify *which* space is being used.

</b-blue>

***Example.*** Consider a state of 2 qbits 

$$ \e\psi = a\e{00} + b\e{01} + c\e{10} + d\e{11} \in V_A \tens V_B $$ 

Where $V = V_A = V_B$ and the first bit belongs to A, the second to B. 

We can form a partial inner product with $\0$ on either space:

\begin{align}
	_A\ip 0 \psi &= a \ip 0 0 _A \0_B + b\ip 0 0 _A \1_B + c \ip 0 1 _A \0_B + d \ip 0 1 _A \1_B \\\\
	&= a \0_B + b \1_B
\end{align}

Note that there is also the identity operator $I : A \tens I = I \tens A = A$ which is just the identity matrix.

### Principle 4 - Quantum Measurements and the Born Rule

> Getting information out of quantum states.
>
> Quantum measurements are invasive -- mmt changes state. 
> So even if a state has exponential info, we can only retrieve a small part of it **probabilistically**.
>
> And by doing so, change the system also.


Given a single instance $\e\psi$ of a quantum state in n-dimensional state space $V$.

<b-blue>

***Def.* The basic born rule:** (or a complete projective mmt / von neumann mmt)

- Let $B = \\{\e e_1 \cdots \e e_n\\}$ be a orth-norm basis of V. A state $\e\psi$ can be described a weighted sum of amplitude-bases:
$$ \e\psi = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \e e_i $$ 

- Taking a measurement of this, we can get n possible outcomes $j = 1..n$, where the probability 
$$P(j) = \abs{\ip {e_j}{\psi}} ^2 = \abs{a_j}^2$$ 

- If outcome $j$ is seen, after mmt **the state is no longer $\e\psi$** but is **collapsed** to $\e{\psi_j} = \e {e_j}$.

</b-blue>

> A complete measurement is just a projection.

Thus repeated measurements on $\e{\psi_j}$ will only give outcomes $j$ forever with certainty.

The straight lines represent mod, and a probability is just the mod squared length of the **projection** of $\e\psi$ onto the given basis $\e {e_j}$. 

After projection, the state is **re-normalised** to have the squared mod sum of amplitudes equal 1 again.

<b-blue>

***Def.* Incomplete projective measurements:** 
- Let $\\{E_1 \cdots E_d \\}$ be a *decomposition* of $V$ into $d$ **mutually orthogonal** subspaces. 
- That is to say, $V = E_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus E_d$ where $\oplus$ is the "direct sum operator"
- Let $\Pi_i$ be a projection operator onto $E_i$.
- An incomplete mmt of $\e\psi$ w.r.t. the decomposition  $\\{E_1 \cdots E_d \\}$ has 
	- d possible outcomes $j = 1..d$
	- Where the probability ("Tr" is trace)
	$$P(j) = \ip{\psi}{\Pi_j^\dagger \Pi_j \vert \psi} = \ip{\psi}{\Pi_j \vert \psi} = \rm{Tr}(\Pi_j \e\psi \b\psi)$$ 
	- Where the post-mmt state is a collapsed normalised vector 
	$$ \e{\psi_j} = \frac{\Pi_j \e\psi}{\sqrt{P(j)}}$$ 

</b-blue>

> No, I don't know what a "direct sum" is either, nor a "Trace"

***Example.*** Parity measurements on two qbit states. 

The **parity** of a bit string $b_1b_2$ is just the mod-2 sum $b_1 \oplus b_2$. Alternatively, it's 1 if there are an odd number of 1s.

Make an orth-norm decomposition of the state $V$ as 
- $E_0 = \span(\e{00}, \e{11})$ :- parity zero
- $E_1 = \span(\e{01}, \e{10})$ :- parity one 

Let $\e\psi = a\e{00} + b\e{01} + c\e{10} + d\e{11}$ 
- The prob of measuring zero $P(0) = \abs{a}^2 + \abs{d}^2$
- The post-measure state $\e{\psi_0} = \frac{a\e{00} + d\e{11}}{\sqrt{\abs{a}^2 + \abs{d}^2}}$

----- 

*Addendum.* define measurement of quantum observables. 

<s-side>

***Def.*** A **quantum observable** $\Omega$ is
- a *hermitian* operator (matrix) on $V$ (meaning $\Omega$ has real eigenvalues $\lambda_{1..d}$) 
- which breaks into orthogonal $\Lambda_j : \dim(\Lambda_j) =$ the multiplicity of $\lambda_j$ (how many times that eig-val appears)
</s-side>
<s-side>

***Def.*** The measurement of such quantum observables is an incomplete mmnt which is relative to this orthogonal decomposition, and labelled by $\lambda_j$. 

</s-side>

The $\lambda_j$ values are the physical properties, and the average value of $\Omega = \sum_{j} \lambda_j P(j)$.

------

<b-blue>

***Def.* the Extended Born Rule**: 
- A special case of incomplete mmnts,
- measuring a component part of a complete system, to only partially destroy it.

Suppose $\e\psi$ is a state of system $S_1 S_2$, which is in a space $V \tens W$. 

Let bases
- $B_V = \\{\e{e_1} \cdots \e{e_n} \\}$ on V;
- $B_W = \\{\e{f_1} \cdots \e{f_m} \\}$ on W.

Then $\e\psi$ can be uniquely expanded as 
$$ \sum_{\forall i,j} c_{ij} \e{e_i} \e{f_j} $$ 

We now label the subspaces (so psi becomes $\e\psi_{VW}$), and we can expand this state as 
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n \e{e_i}_V \e{\xi_i}_W $$ 
Where $\e{\xi_i}$ is some arbitrary vector in the space W, which is generally **not** normalised nor orthogonal. (in reality $\e{\xi\_i}_W =\\, _V\ip{e\_i}{\psi}\_{VW}$)

Since $\e\psi_{VW}$ is normalised, we know that $\sum_{i=1}^n \ip{\xi_i}{\xi_i} = 1 = \ip\psi\psi$, and so we can perform a mmnt on $\e\psi$ relative to basis $B_V$ 
- A *complete measurement on $V$ but not $V \tens W$*

We have:
- outcomes $i = 1..n$, 
- corresponding orthogonal subspaces of $V \tens W$:
$$E_i = \span\\{ \e{e_i} \tens \e\xi : \xi \in W \\}$$ 
or by abusing notation $\e{e_i} \tens W$;
- which have projectors $\Pi_i = \e{e_i}\b{e_i} \tens I_W$ (identity), which we get with probability $P(i) = \ip {\xi_i}{\xi_i}$ 
- And post measurement state 
$$ \e{\psi_i} = \frac{\e{e\_i}_V \e{\xi\_i}_W}{ \sqrt{\ip{\xi\_i}{\xi\_i}} }. $$

</b-blue>

Some remarks:
- Orthogonal states are perfectly distinguishable, but non-orthogonal states are **not** completely distinguishable even if physically different.
- If $\e\psi$ has dimension $n$, any measurement on it has at most $n$ outcomes
- **But** if we adjoin it with a known quantum state, an **ancilla** $\e A$ of dimension m, that is independent of $\e\psi$, then we can measure them jointly ($\e\psi \e A$) to get $m\cdot n$ outcomes.

### Basic Unitary Operators for Qubits

#### Single Qubits 

We have unitary operators for single qbits.

***Hadamard Gate.***
$$ H = \frac{1 }{\sqrt{2} } \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1
\end{bmatrix} $$ 

This is a gate with the following properties:
- $HH = I$. 
- $H \0 = \frac{1 }{\sqrt{2} }(\0 + \1) = \e+$
- $H \1 = \frac{1 }{\sqrt{2} }(\0 - \1) = \e-$

> This is just a rotation of 45&deg; to the +/- bases.

***Pauli Gates.***
\begin{matrix}
	I = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix} &
	\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix} & 
	\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & -i \\\\ i & 0
	\end{bmatrix} & 
	\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}

These are all unitary hermitian operators, with the following properties:
- Multiplicative properties: $\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + \sigma_z^2 = I$ 
	- This also implies the eigenvalues are $\pm 1$.
- Anti-commute properties: $\sigma_x\sigma_y = -\sigma_y\sigma_x = i\sigma_z$ 
	- These can be swapped with any combination of $x,y,z$ as long as they are in that order.

Pauli gates also have real versions:
\begin{matrix}
	X = \sigma_x & 
	Y = i\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0
	\end{bmatrix} & 
	Z = \sigma_z
\end{matrix}

Such that 
- $X\0 = \1$, and $X\1 = \0$ -- *quantum NOT gate* 
	- i.e. $X\e k = \e{k \oplus 1} \pod{k=0,1}$ 
	- X's eigenbases are $\e+, \e-$ 
- $Z\0 = \0$, and $Z\1 = -\1$
	- i.e. $Z\e{k} = (-1)^k \e{k}$ 
	- Z's eigenbases are $\0, \1$

***Phase Gate.*** 
$$ P(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{i\theta}	
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Where $\theta$ is the angle of rotation. 

#### Double Qubits 

***Controlled X-gate.*** Also called CNOT, CX, controlled-NOT, etc. 

Where 
$$ CX \e j \e k = \e j \e{j \oplus k} = \e j X^j \e k$$ 
- That is, if $\e j$ is zero, do not apply the gate, and if $\e j$ is one, then apply $X\e k$. 
- $CX \0 \e\alpha = \0\e\alpha$ whilst $CX \1 \e\alpha = \1 X\e\alpha$. 

CX operates over two bits, thus the CX matrix is a 4x4 that:
$$ 
CX = \left[ \begin{array}{c:c} 
I & \mathbf{0} \\\\ \hdashline
\mathbf{0} & X 
\end{array} \right] = \begin{bmatrix}
	1&0&0&0\\\\0&1&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&1 \\\\ 0&0&1&0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that the **order is important** to CX, and so often it is labelled with `12` or `21` with `1` being the control bit, and `2` being the applied bit. So
- $CX_{12} \0_1 \1_2 = \0_1 \1_2$ 
- $CX_{21} \0_1 \1_2 = X\0_1 \1_2 = \1_1 \1_2$

***Controlled Z-Gate.*** 
$$
CZ_{12} \e j \e k = \e{j} Z^j \e k = (-1)^{jk} \e j \e k
$$ 
CZ is **symmetric**: so the order actually doesn't matter, and 
$$ 
CZ = \left[ \begin{array}{c:c} 
I & \mathbf{0} \\\\ \hdashline
\mathbf{0} & Z 
\end{array} \right]
$$

***General Controlled Gate $CU$.*** Has the form 
$$ 
CU = \left[ \begin{array}{c:c} 
I & \mathbf{0} \\\\ \hdashline
\mathbf{0} & U 
\end{array} \right]
$$

### Quantum States as Information Carriers

A qbit is the simplest system that can reliably encode a classical bit.

Information is proportional to the number of distinguishable states of a physical system.
- Classically, any two different states are distinguishable (trivially)
- Quantumly, states are **distinguishable** $\iff$ they are **orthogonal**
	- So if you take $\0$ and $\e+$, and a black box that outputs any one of the two, it is **impossible** to certainly identify which one it is.

Given some quantum information $\e\psi$, we can do 3 basic things:

1. **Ancilla.** Take a fixed known quant-state $\e A$ and adjoin it to our state to get a bigger one: $\e{\tilde{\psi}} = \e\psi \e A$.
2. **Unitary.** Apply a unitary operator $U$ 
3. **Measure.** Take a measurement on all or part of $\e\psi$, thus 
	- Can record result 
	- And based on outcomes choose further steps 
	- Output is generally probabilistic. 

And **any combination of the 3**.


### The No Cloning Theorem

> Quantum information cannot be copied or cloned.

Copying classical information is trivial. To relate it to operators, we can just use a CNOT operator. 

More generally, any copying process has the form
- $(b) (0) (M)$ an information register (with $b$), a blank register (with 0), and an internal machine state $M$ which is in the **Ready** state 
- And goes to $(b) (b) (M_2)$ with the blank register having the copy, and the machine state being $M_b$ post copy (since it can change during copy.)

$$ (b) (0) (M) \lra_{CNOT} (b)(b)(M)$$ 

Quantumly:
- Given some information $\e\psi_A$,
- Copying is a *quantum evolution* process of subsystems $A, B, M$. We want 
$$ \e\psi_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_? \e\psi\_A \e\psi\_B \e{M\_\psi}_M $$
- Where B is the blank register space, and M is any extra space needed, which is initially in ready state $M_0$ independent of $\e\psi_A$. 

<b-blue>

***Theorem.*** **No cloning theorem** (Unitary version)

Let $S$ be any known set of quantum states of system $A$, that contains at least one pair $\e\xi, \e\eta : \e\xi \neq \e\eta$ and they are orthogonal. 

Then there exist **no unitary process** that achieves cloning of all states in $S$. 

</b-blue>

Remarks:
- If $\e\xi = \e\eta$, then there is only one state and it clones fine 
- If $\e\xi \perp \e\eta$, then they can also clone fine (can rotate to $\0, \1$ and apply CX)
	- So $CX \e k \0 = \e k \e k : k = 0,1$, 
	- but $CX(a\0 + b\1)\0 = a\e{00} + \e{11} \neq (a\0 + b\1)(a\0 + b\1)$. 
- No unitary process means no combination of operations above. 

<s-side>

***Proof.*** Let $\e\xi, \e\eta$ be two different non-orth states. Then we require the cloning process to 
$$ \e\xi\_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_U \e\xi_A \e\xi_B \e{M\_\xi}_M $$ 
$$ \e\eta\_A \0_B \e{M\_0}\_M \lra\_U \e\eta_A \e\eta_B \e{M\_\eta}_M $$ 

***Note.** Unitary processes preserve inner products.*

Therefore
\begin{align}
	\ip\xi\eta \ip00 \ip{M_0}{M_0} &= \ip\xi\eta \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta}\\\\
	\implies \ip\xi\eta &= \ip\xi\eta \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta}
\end{align}
Since anything inner prod itself = 1 (in normalised vectors).

Since $\e\xi \neq \e\eta$, we know $0 &lt; \ip\xi\eta &lt; 1$, and $0 \leq \ip{M_\xi}{M_\eta} \leq 1$ (we don't really care what the machine state is)

Thus 
$$ 1 = \ip\xi\eta \ip{M_\xi} {M_\eta}  $$
Which is a contradiction since neither of the two terms on the right can ever multiply to 1. $\Box$
