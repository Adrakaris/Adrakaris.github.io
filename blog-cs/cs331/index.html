				### Learning paradigms

				There are three learning paradigms:

				* Supervised learning, where you have labelled data and model tries to find correct labels 
				* Unsupervised learning, where there are no labels
				* Reinforcement learning, where model has states and actions, and feedback given based on that

				Supervised learning tries to approximate a function $f:X \lra Y$

				Unsupervised learning tries to *find* a function given an $X$ 

				Reinforcement learning is like [Little Albert and the Rat](https://www.simplypsychology.org/little-albert.html)

				### Transfer Learning 

				Transfer learning is taking a pre-trained model, and retraining it to perform a similar task. I.e. taking an ImageNet classifier (knows 1000 types of objects) and training it further to recognise new categories of your own choosing. 

				This concept of "incremental learning" builds on previous work done, and is faster and less effort than going from zero.

				Advantage:

				* Allows training with less data since you reuse models
				* Takes less time
				* Takes advantage of existing good architecture (not reinvent the wheel)

				The idea is to modify and retrain only the later stages/later layers. Naturally you have to set your own learning parameters still.

				### Neurons 

				Your central nervous system (Brain, spine) has neurons. Neurons make think. Yes, this is relevant and examined. 
				
				Neurons generate signals (**action potentials**), which pass to other neurons.

			<div class="md-conv">
				**Dendrites** are tree-like structures with small spines which the synapses (ends) of other neurons connect to. They receive information.

				The **Soma** is the cell body, and is where all the signals (charges) received go. They are put in the **axon hillock**, and if the signal exceeds a threshold, the neuron passes on the signal. 

				The **axon** is the long thing which connects the axon terminals (synapses) to the rest of the cell. The larger the diameter the axon has, the fast it transmits data. Axons have a fatty myalin sheath insulating it, and if this is degraded axon transmission effectiveness worsens. 

				Altogether, a neuron takes in input, has an **activation function** which transforms the signal, and then makes output. 

				There are three classes of neurons: **sensory, motor, relay/inter**.

				Sensory neurons take input, motor neurons make output, and relay neurons relay data between them. 


				### Signal propagation

				Signals are propagated electrically, called "membrane potential". 

				It comes from the voltage potential across the nerve fibre -- the cell membrane. 

				Inside the cell are lots of $K^+$ ions. Outside are a lot of $Na^+$ ions. Their inequality forms the voltage potential, which is at rest around -70 mV. This is the **resting potential**.

				Across the cell membrane there are **channels** and **pumps**:

				* The **leaky channels**, which allows the free travel of $Na^+$ and $K^+$ through (is not gated)
				* The **volt-gated channels**, which only opens at certain voltages, and are generally closed at resting potential.
				* The **Sodium-Potassium Pump**, which removes 3$Na^+$ and takes in 2$K^+$.

				Neurons obey the "all or nothing" principle of firing; any stimulus under the threshold, no matter how big, does not fire, but anything that reaches it produces a full response. 

				See the graph for the phases.

			<div class="md-conv">
				A neuron is **polarised** if it is more negative on the inside. **hyperpolarisation** is when the membrane potential is below resting potential, whilst **depolarisation** is when it's above. 

				The threshold is around -55 mV. 

				A stimulus causes some Na+ volt-gated gates to open, but if it's not enough it'll go back again. 
				
				When the threshold is reached it causes a rush of volt-gated gates to open, giving a spike of voltage up to 30 +mV.
				
				When it closes it hyperpolarises, and corrects itself. 

				### Synaptic transmission

				Synapses transfer chemically, via **neurotransmitters**, which are released from vesicles, and travel to receptors on the opposing synapse/dendrite.

				They can either be **excitatory** (causing action) or **inhibitory** (preventing action)

				Note that axon terminals don't have to connect to dendrites. They can connect to dendrites, somas, and other axons. Dendrites can also connect to dendrites.
