				**BOOK.** PMBOK (Project Management Book of Knowledge)

			</div>

			<div class="md-conv">



				Project management, to use a cyclic definition, is about managing projects. A balancing act.

				It is about making plans, managing costs and deadlines. 

				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Project-triangle-en.svg/1200px-Project-triangle-en.svg.png" alt="pm triangle" title="Iron Triangle (wikipedia)" style="float: right; max-width: 200px;">

				A project is constrained by the **iron triangle** (right). <span class="grey">You can hover on these images if they're unfigured</span>

				I.e. your project can be up to 2 of good (big scope), quick (big time), or cheap (big cost [saving]), but not all 3.

				Depending on where your customer priorities are on that triangle, you do what you do. 

				**The triangle is rigid and non-negotiable**, no matter what the customer says.

				There are higher level "shapes" that you can get by adding more points, such as the "Titanium tetrahedron" (+quality), "hard hexagram" (+risk, resources), and the "difficult dodecahedron" (+procurement, stakeholders, communication, integration).

				They tried really hard with the shape names, but fundamentally there are 10 knowledge areas for PM:

				<div class="ctwo blue">
					<div>
						* Scope
						* Time
						* Cost 
						* Quality 
						* Risk 
					</div>
					<div>
						* Resources 
					* Procurement 
					* Stakeholders 
					* communication
					* Integration.
					</div>
				</div>
				

				These are formalised in PMBOK, and like good business people, abbreviated to **KA**s. 

				<hr>


				

				PMBOK by the project management institute is a PM framework. 

				<img src="./assets/pmbok-pgs.png" alt="" title="Progress group diagram (Ian Saunders)" style="float:right;max-width: 200px; border-right: 1px solid var(--blue);border-top: 1px solid var(--blue);">

				A project is split into 10 **KA**s (as above), and 5 process groups (**PG**s). <span class="grey">Get used to the acronyms; as we mentioned this is not a business module /s</span> 

				5 times 10 makes ... 49 individual **processes** (yes I know)

				The five PGs, or *stages*, are:

				

				<div class="blue">

					
					
					1. **Initiation** -- business case (why do the project?)
					2. **Planning** -- Balancing time, cost, scope, risk... 
					3. **Execution** -- Doing 
					4. **Monitoring/Controlling** -- making sure progress is made/project on track 
					5. **Closing** -- delivery and reflections.
				</div>

				And thus the 49 processes are given as follows:

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/pmbok-processes.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>Individual Processes. (Ian Saunders)</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv">
				### Initiation

				The **Project Mandate** (or statement of work) is a document that details 
				* What the project is exactly,
				* The scope of the project,
				* Any constraints,
				* Any assumptions, 
				* Any known risks/issues.

				The **Business case** is a justification of why the project should be done, what benefits it gives, etc, etc, as well as the timeline. 

				In the "Initiation" stage, we take the project mandate and business case, and **develop a project charter**.

				We also identify stakeholders.

				<div class="blue">

					The ***Project charter*** formally authorises the start of the project. 

					It requires:
					<div class="ctwo">
						<div>
							* Project mandate, 
							* business case, 
							* agreements and contracts, 
						</div>
						<div>
							* quality standards, 
							* and organisational processes and lessons learned from previous projects.
						</div>
					</div>
					And creates as output:
					<div class="ctwo">
						<div>
							* Project justification 
							* Measurable objectives, success criteria 
							* High level requirements, risks, constraints
						</div>
						<div>
							* Summary schedule and budget 
							* Stakeholder list, *assigned project manager*, authorities
						</div>
					</div>
					
				</div>

				Outputs are different from outcomes are different from benefits.

				**Outputs** detail what is produces, **Outcomes** detail immediate effects, and **benefits** detail what good those effects do for the company/client.

				Objectives should be **SMART**. That is, Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv">
				### Stakeholders 

				Stakeholders are anyone with involvement in the project. 

				This includes the sponsor, customers/users, sellers, partners, HR, etc, etc.

				Stakeholders can be put in a power-interest grid, based on Interest in the $x$ axis, and Power/Influence in the $y$ axis.

			<div class="md-conv" id="pla-1">
				### Project Plans

				This is where the appointed project manager takes over.

				Planning is continuous.

				To make a plan, we must 
				* break down work required and timeline 
				* set out milestones and bottlenecks 
				* plan the budget and allocate resources.

				We can also go back and iterate on these points.

				This falls under the "Planning" PG of PMBOK. 
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv" id="pla-2">
				<img src="" alt="">
				### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

				And we say this isn't a business module.

				A WBS is a way **manage scope**. By decomposing the package into **deliverables**. 

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/wbs.png" alt="" style="max-width: 600px;">
					<figcaption>Work breakdown structure (Yijun Hu)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				It is structured in a tree that breaks down a project into deliverable stages (and not processes!)

				From the top level project, we can decompose it into different **components** (top yellow)

				These components decompose into **work packages** (bottom yellow), and these work package decompose into **subtasks**.

				<hr>

				A **work package** (WP) is a mostly self-contained task, with clearly defined interactions and objectives. It can be thought of as the smallest whole unit to a WBS.

				Each work package can be thought of as its own milestone.

				The sizes of the work packages can vary, with different benefits and downsides.

				* A **small** WP is more able to be estimated and can be more easily worked on in parallel, but means there are more inter-WP interactions, they may be harder to define, or there may be duplication of work between WPs.
				* A **large** WP can make more efficient use of and easier to manage your team (as small WPs = micromanaging), but are harder to break down and has greater risk of overrun. Also, you can't micromanage as much. 

				A WBS is deliverable based -- that is, it relates to **work** rather than **purpose** (which would be objectives based). 

				It details WHAT, and not WHY or HOW. 

				This makes them easier to estimate and to manage scope properly, but it may lose sight of objectives, and restricts creativity, and does not consider processes.

				*We want to stay focused on objectives:* can break the runes of WBS a bit, and break down logically process-wise.

				*We want to plan schedule and budget:* can annotate that on after on the WBS 

				*We want to encourage creativity:* This is a you problem (as the PM), and not a WBS problem.
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv" id="pla-3">
				### Time Management

				We want to estimate the duration of each of our activities. 

				* We can use **analogy**, seeing how long a similar project took, adjusted to these conditions.
				* **Parametrics**, doing the same but with statistical models, 
				* **Team based**, ask your team who are doing the work, or
				* we can pretend this is more mathematically rigorous than it actually is by using the **Three-Point method**:

				<div class="side">
					Given a mean (estimated time) $m$, a minimum $a$, and a maximum $b$, there are two functions we can use to estimate time:

					\begin{align}
						t_\rm{triangular} &= \fr{a+m+b}{3} \\ 
						t_\rm{beta} &= \fr{a + 4m + b}{6}
					\end{align}
				</div>

				We then need to **sequence** these activities to try to parallelise. 

				This is invariably done using a **gantt chart**!

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/gantt-chart.png" alt="">
					<figcaption>A Gantt Chart (Ian Saunders)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				The gantt chart shows task duration, and you can draw arrows to show dependencies.

				You can even partial-fill in the bars to show progress.

				<hr>

				We can also show dependencies using a **project network diagram (PND)**, a graph which you then use critical path analysis on.

				There are two ways of representing it: either activities on nodes, or activities on edges. Personally I find the former easier.

				<figure>
				<img src="./assets/pnd.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>Two ways of doing project diagrams. (Ian Saunders)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				The **critical path** is the path from start to end, where none of the activities can be delayed without delaying the final ending time of the project. 

				There are six properties:
				* **Duration** $D$: The duration of the activity 
				* **Earliest start** $ES$, earliest time the activity can start -- the latest $EF$ from all its parents 
				* The **earliest finish** $EF = ES + D$
				* The **latest finish** $LF$, the latest time the activity can finish without delaying project -- the earliest $LS$ from its children 
				* The **latest start** $LS = LF - D$
				* The **total float** $TF$, which is the amount of delay time for the activity until the project is delayed.$TF = LS - ES = LF - EF$.

				**Free float** is the amount of delay time until the *following activity* is delayed. $FF \leq TF$.

				The critical path analysis method goes as follows:
				1. Construct the diagram. Mark on all the durations.
				2. Go **forward** through the graph. Mark $ES = \max_{EF}($immediate parents$)$, and $EF = ES +D$.
				4. It can be helpful to make the "end" node an activity, with 0 duration. Then mark $LS = LF = EF$. 
				3. Go **backward** through the graph, and mark $LF = \min_{LS}($immediate successors$)$, then $LS = LF - D$, then $TF = LS - ES$.

				The **critical paths** are the paths from start to finish, where all floats are **zero**.

				**Drag time** is the amount of time a critical task holds up the project. i.e. it is the amount of time its duration needs to be reduced by, to make it no longer critical. This is either the **duration** $D$, or the **minimums of floats** $\min(TF)$ of parallel tasks, whichever is **lower**.

				**Crashing** is forcibly reducing an activity's time to speed up the project. This really only has to be done on the critical path. 
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv" id="pla-4">
				### Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) 

				<img src="./assets/beta-triangle.png" alt="" style="float:right; " title="Beta and triangle distributions (Ian Saunders)">

				A modification on the regular duration measures, to allow for pessimistic and optimistic time estimates. 

				Using the triangle and beta distributions (pictured right). 

				As a reminder, given the most likely time $m$ (previously used for $D$), the shortest estimate $a$, and the longest estimate $b$,

				The mean

				\[
				\begin{align}
					t_\rm{tri} &= \fr{a+b+m}{3} & t_\beta &= \fr{a+4m+b}{6}
				\end{align}
				\]

				The variance 
				\[\begin{align}
					\sigma^2_\rm{tri} &= \fr{a^2 + b^2 + m^2 - ab - am - bm}{18} &
					\sigma^2_\beta &= \left( \fr{b-a}{6} \right)^2 
				\end{align}\]

				Thus rather than using a fixed duration, we use three durations $a, m, b$.

				Then, for critical path we can work out the mean $t$ and variance $\sigma^2$

				### Introduction

				<div class="blue">

					**BOOK.** PRINCE2&reg; For Beginners

				</div>

				PRINCE2 was developed for IT projects, which don't usually manage the traditional way. It is generic, and comes with a lot of paperwork.

				It is a **product-based planning** methodology, focusing on deliverables and products.

				Opponents say that is inflexible, bureaucratic, and only suitable for large projects.

				Get ready for a lot of businessy sounding titles:

				***The seven princples of Prince2.***

				1. **Continuous business justification** (is there still a benefit, is it still viable)
				2. **Learn from Experience** 
				3. **Defined roles and responsibilities**
				4. **Manage by stages** (break down project)
				5. **Manage by expectation** (Set limits, and allow people to work by themselves within those limits )
				6. **Focus on products** (what, not how and why)
				7. **Tailor to suit project environment** (If it isn't convenient don't follow this methodology as written.)

				***The seven processes of Prince2.*** Corresponds to the process groups of pmbok. And to be extra businessy, they each have their own acronym.

				1. **SU.** Starting Up 
				2. **DP.** Directing a project
				3. **IP.** Initiating a project 
				4. **SB.** Managing a stage boundary 
				5. **CS.** Controlling a stage 
				6. **MP.** Managing product delivery 
				7. **CP.** Closing project

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/pmbok-to-prince2.png" alt="" style="max-width: 500px;">
					<figcaption>PMBOK PGs to Prince2 Processes (Ian Saunders)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				One notable thing is that directing DP has no equivalent in pmbok.

				We can alter the pmbok diagram into the prince2 diagram, and add in DP to get the diagram.

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/prince2-diagram.png" alt="" style="max-width: 480px;">
				</figure>				

				Notice how at every stage, directing is done from the project board.

				Every single thing can be communicated with and fed back from the board -- probably too micromanaging for some people's tastes.
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv" id="prince-2">
				### Roles

				The project team compromises a **project board**, and a **project manager**.

				The **board** is a panel that represent stakeholders, such as the business, the end-user, and people doing the work. They are held accountable for the project's success.

				The **project manager** does the day-to-day management, and takes authorisation from the board. They need approval to change plan beyond agreed limits. 

				Further beyond the board you get the *sponsor*: the entity that commissions, funds, audits, etc. the project. 
			</div>

			<div class="md-conv" id="prince-3">
				### Everything Else (themes, etc.)

				Had enough of sevens? Tough!

				Here are the **seven themes of prince2**:

				* The **business case.** is it feasible, desirable, and achievable?
				* **Organisation.** responsibilities and accountabilities.
				* **Quality.** and meeting requirements
				* **Risks.** identify, assess, and control 
				* **Plan.** what, when, how, who 
				* **Change.** reacting and adapting 
				* **Progress.** everything progressing as intended?

				

				<hr>

				Prince2 produces **Management products**, which are about as stuffy as they sound.

				These include things like 

				* **Records** such as logs, registers
				* **baselines** such as the approval documents, initiation documents, management strategies, and various plans 
				* **Reports** during stage boundaries, and for changes and exceptions.

				**Business case** makes the **business case outline** as well as the **business case** itself, and continuously assesses the viability and justifiability of the project. Things are formally verified by the project board for each key decision.

				**Organisation** makes the **project management team structure**, creating tables showing who's accountable for what.

				**Plans** come in many varieties, including overall **project plan**, **initiation plan** (plan for the plan), **next stage plan** (plan each stage in turn), **team plan** (for WPs), and **exception plans** (for when things go wrong.)

				**Quality** focuses on products. We make the **project product description (PPD)**, which talks about deliverables and customer expectations; the **quality management strategy** about standards and procedures; the **product description**, and the **quality register** for all "quality events" planned and undertaken.

				**Progress** measures against the project plan. This produces **progress reports** and **exception reports** 

				**Risk** needs to identify risks, assess their impact, plan against them, implement plans, and communicate this to relevant parties. It makes the **risk register**. 

				**Change** is about managing by exception. Once we capture an issue, we need to examine (assess impact), consider options, decide whether or not to escalate (-> exception report), and take corrective action. This makes the **issue register** and **issue reports**.

				This is why opponents say it's inflexible and paperwork heavy.
