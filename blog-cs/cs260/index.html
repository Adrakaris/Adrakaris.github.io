				A <i>Greedy Algorithm</i> is one that builds up a solution from small steps, snatching or discarding the next available one without regard for the bigger picture, based on some simple rule(s).

					<p>
						You manage a scheduling system for a conference room, and want to schedule as many meetings as possible, with no overlap between meetings and no rearranging of meeting times. 
					</p>
                    <p>
						Let us call meetings <i>jobs</i>, the general term for this problem. Job \(j\) starts at time \(s_j\) and finishes at \(f_j\). Two jobs are <b>compatible</b> [to be scheduled] if they do not overlap.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our goal is to make an algorithm with the following inputs and outputs
						<ul>
							<li><b><span class="sc">in:</span></b> A sequence of jobs (which are just pairs \((s_j,f_j\))</li>
							<li><b><span class="sc">out:</span></b> The <b>maximum subset</b> of mutually compatible jobs</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						We can use a greedy algorithm to solve this, but we need the rules that allow us to implement it. We'll sort the jobs by a specific rule, then take jobs in order, provided they are compatible with all the jobs already selected. 
					</p>

					<p>
						This ordering rule can be many things: earliest start time, earliest finish time, or shortest interval time being some possibilities. (You can try work out which one is correct, but I'm going to immediately reveal it below.)

				<div class="ir">
					<p>Earliest Finish First</p>

						<b><i>Theorem.</i></b> The Earliest Finish First (EFF) algorithm is optimal.
					</p>
					
					<button class="collapsible">Proof...</button>
					<div class="ccontent">
						<p><b><i>Proof.</i></b> We will prove by contradiction. Let us assume EFF is not optimal.</p>
						<p>
							Let \(i_1, i_2, ..., i_k\) be the set of jobs selected by EFF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let \(j_1, j_2, ..., j_m\) be the optimal set, with \(i_1 = j_1, i_2 = j_2, ... i_r = j_r\) for as large of a value of \(r\) as possible. If EFF is not optimal, then \(m > k\).
						</p>
						<p>
							If job \(i_{r+1}\) does not exist, then by nature of the algorithm all jobs after \(i_r\) are incompatible with it. However, since \(i_r = j_r\), and we know that the optimal must <i>strictly</i> have more jobs than EFF, there must be compatible jobs after \(i_r\), thus we reach a contradiction.
						</p>

						<p>
							If job \(i_{r+1}\) exists, it cannot finish later than \(j_{r + 1}\), because of the sorting rule. Thus we can just replace \(j_{r+1}\) with \(i_{r+1}\), and guarantee that all jobs \(j_r+2\) and afterwards is compatible. Thus the optimal is still optimal, and the condition that we have the <i>largest possible \(r\)</i> has been violated.

						<p>
							<b><i>Proof.</i></b> Let \(d =\) the number of rooms ESF allocates.

							Thus there will be \(d\) lectures overlapping at some time \(s_k + \epsilon\) for a number \(\epsilon\), which is our depth. Since depth = max number of rooms, this demonstrates that ESF is optimal.

						Divide and conquer is a strategy for solving algorithms where the main problem is <b>divided</b> into <b>independent</b> subproblems, which are then solved (<b>conquered</b>) <b>recursively</b>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In general, this goes as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Divide a problem of size \(n\) into subgroups, e.g. 2 subproblems of size \(\frac{n}{2}\) - <i>typically \(O(n)\)</i></li>
							<li>Solve the 2 subproblems recursively</li>
							<li>Combine the subproblems into one - <i>typically \(O(n)\)</i></li>

						So far we have been ignoring floors and ceilings. In fact, we can take as granted that <b>floor and ceil may be ignored</b> outright. However, here's an inductive proof for the assertion that uses floor and ceil. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b><i>Assertion 2.</i></b> \(T(n) \leq n \left \lceil{\log_2 n} \right \rceil\) if \(T(n)\) satisfies the following recurrence. \(n\) is not assumed to be a power of 2.

							<b><i>Proof.</i></b> Strong induction on \(n\). Instead of just assuming the prior is true, we assume <i>all priors</i> are true. The base case is the same and is true. Please note \(\log\) means \(\log_2\). 
						</p>
						<p>
							Let \(n_1 = \left \lfloor{n} \right \rfloor\) and \(n_2 = \left \lceil{n} \right \rceil\). <i>Note that \(n_1 + n_2 = n\)</i>. The <b>inductive hypothesis</b> is that the recurrence is satisifed for <b>all</b> values up to \(n-1\).

							Some easy-to-miss changes are circled. The circles are for emphasis and are otherwise meaningless.
							\begin{align}
								T(n) &\leq T(n_1) + T(n_2) + n \\
								&\leq n_1 \left \lceil{\log n_1} \right \rceil + n_2 \left \lceil{\log n_2} \right \rceil + n \textrm{ by ind hyp.} \\
								\because n_2 \geq n_1,\; T(n) &\leq n_1 \left \lceil{\log

								& \leq n (\left\lceil{\log  {\scriptstyle \enclose{circle}{\kern .06em n \kern .06em}} }\right\rceil + 1) + n \; *\\
								& \leq n \left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil .

						<p>
							The jump marked \(*\) is explained as follows:
							\begin{align}
								2^{\log n_2} = n_2 &= \left\lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right\rceil \\
								&\leq \left\lceil{\frac{2^\left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil }{2}}\right\rceil \\
								&\textrm{since } n = 2^{\log n} \textrm{, } 2^{\left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil } \textrm{ must be not lower. } \\
								&\leq \frac{2^{\left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil }}{2} \textrm{ since RHS must } \in \mathbb{Z} \\
								&\leq 2^{\left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil -1} \\
								\therefore \log n_2 = \log{2^{\log n_2}} &= \left\lceil{\log n}\right\rceil - 1.

						<p>Problem </p>

						<p>
							Given \(n\) points in a euclidean plane, find the closest pair of points. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>Possible non-divide and conquer solutions</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Listed are some non-divide and conquer solutions, for interest. 
						</p>
						<button class="collapsible">Expand... </button>
						<div class="ccontent">
							<p>
								<b>Brute force</b>: the "naive" algorithm, I think you can guess what this does. Solves in \(\Theta(n^2)\) but we can do better. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Dimension collapsing</b>: we can consider only 1 dimension (say, x), sort the points and find the closest. This can be done in \(\Theta(n \log n)\) by sorting points, and comparing only consecutive ones. The only problem is it has counterexamples and may not always work depending on your configuration of points.
							</p>
							<p>
								This relies on an assumption of <i>non-degeneracy</i> (see later).
							</p>
							<p>
								We can extend this idea to doing dimension collapsing for 2D by repeating the process for both x and y, finding the points which are closest together on those two axes.
							</p>
							<p>
								However this is also flawed and has counterexamples. 
							</p>

							<p>
								<b>Division:</b> We can try a technique more akin to divide and conquer - dividing the space up into halves or quadrants, then considering each quadrant separately, then the boundaries of quadrants. Ideally we'd want all quadrants to have an equal number of dots, but this is hard to guarantee. 
							</p>

					<div>
						<p>The divide and conquer algorithm</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							<b><i>Definition.</i></b> the <b>non-degeneracy</b> assumption asserts that each point should have a unique \(x\) coordinate. 
						</p>
						<p>
							We <b>divide</b> by drawing a vertical line \(L : \frac{n}{2}\) points on each side. We <b>conquer</b> by recursively finding the closest point in each "half". We <b>combine</b> by checking if there's a closer pair that lies across the boundary. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It seems initially hard to do this more efficiently than the brute force \(n^2 \), but there are a few tricks we can employ. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Take the minimum distance from the pairs on either side, let it be \(\delta\). Say our two halves find closest points with length 12 and 21, \(\delta = \min(12, 21)\). It is the sufficient to <b>only check points within \(\delta\) distance from L</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We need only sort the boundary points by their \(y\) coordinate, then compute the closest points in \(y\). This much may be quite easy to understand, but that still leaves us with quadratic time if we have to compute distances to all other points, but in fact, we only need to compute <b>7</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Every point checks against up to 7 others, and the minimum distance found is kept track of as the boundary points are iterated through. This actually will reduce our combine step down to <b>linear time</b>: \(O(n)\).
