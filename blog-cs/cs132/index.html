						Representations and Binary.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Numbers can be represented in many different ways (decimal, octal, etc) but we most often use binary when dealing with computer systems.
					</p>

					<p>
						Computers work with transistors, and <b>TTL</b> (transistor-transistor logic) works over voltages. Transistors work over a range of about five volts, and we assign the range 0 - 0.8V as 0 and 2.4 - 5V as 1 (and a forbidden zone in the middle), which gives us binary values. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The reason we do this is to achieve something called <b>noise immunity</b>, where natural fluctuations in voltage won't affect the bits.
					</p>

						Mathematical Operators.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Do recall that overflow exists when working in binary. 
					</p>

					<p>
						We can (fairly) easily make a circuit that adds two binary numbers. However what do we do for subtraction? We could either build a subtractor, or easier find a way to represent negative binary numbers. How about working with decimal numbers.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">
						(Negatives) Signed Magnitude
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						The largest bit of a binary number acts as the <i>sign</i>, a "flag" which is 1 if the number is negative and 0 if the number is positive;
						\[1101_{2SM} = -1 \times (4 + 0 + 1) = -5.\]
						This can represent numbers in the range \([-2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1}]\), for \(n\) bits.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						(Negatives) Two's Complement
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						The more commonly used, two's complement is where the largest bit is a negative number;
						\[1101_{2TC} = -8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = -3.\]
						Two's complement represent numbers in the range \([-2^{n-1}, 2^{n-1}-1]\), and a major advantage of two's complement is that it has no unique zero. Signed magnitude numbering has two zeros, \(1000 \equiv 0000\) which can be problematic, whilst two's complement has only \(0000\).
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						(Decimals) Fixed Point
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						A fixed decimal point where to the right are negative powers of two. However this is limited by accuracy (depending on where the fixed point is), nor can it represent very large numbers
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						(Decimals) Floating Point
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						A floating point number is represented with \( (\textrm{sign}) \textrm{ mantissa} \times 2^{\textrm{exponent}} \). One bit is allocated to the sign, a few for the exponent, and the rest for the mantissa. More bits equal more numbers that can be represented.
					</p>

					<button class="collapsible nul">IEE754...</button>
					<div class="ccontent cnul">
						<p>
							The IEEE 754 standard gives 32 bits for a single float, 64 bits for a double, and 128 bits for a quad. For a single precision float, 1 bit is the sign, 8 bits for the exponent and 23 bits for the mantissa.

					<p>
						Note that NOT, AND and OR are <b>fundamental</b> gates, since they are the building blocks of any function.
					</p>

					<p>
						NAND and NOR are <b>universal</b> gates, since they alone can be used to make any other logic gate. 
					</p>
					

					<p>
						We often want to simplify expressions as possible, because simplifying expressions leads to less logic gates, which is cheaper. (Also, simplifying to one universal gate can also be cheaper due to economy of scale of buying only one gate.)
					</p>

					<p>
						Two main methods of simplification are <b>boolean algebra</b> and <b>Karnaugh Maps</b>. Boolean algebra is covered in <a href="../cs130/index.html#proplogic" class="text">CS130</a>, though of course do note that 132 uses different syntax.

			<div class="cornell">
				<div>
					<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">
						K-maps.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Karnaugh maps (also called k-maps) can show unambiguously a boolean expression in its simplest form. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Look at the following table. It is a k-map for 3 variables \(A, B, C\). The top row groups AB together, and the left column displays values of C. Within the table each of the squares represent a different combination of values of A, B, C to input into a function we want to simplify.
					</p>

					<img src="logic/kmap-example.png" style="max-width: 100%;">

					<p>
						Note the ordering of AB: 00 <b>01 11</b> 10. This is <i>deliberate</i>, and with this ordering it means that to "step" from any square to any orthogonally adjacent (sides touching) square, the result will differ by <b>only one variable.</b>
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						Rules.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Usually, when you get a function, only certain squares in the grid will give an overall result of 1. We do this by a process of <b>grouping 1s</b>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Basically, in a map, you want to group adjacent ones. The groups must be <b>rectangular</b> in shape, and not have any "turns" - an L shape for example is forbidden. Furtherfore, groups must be <b>powers of two</b> in size.
					</p>

					<p>
						Groups may <b>wrap around</b> edges - like pacman. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Groups are permitted to overlap.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Minimum no. of groups</b>, ideally bigger size groups, make more <b>optimal solution</b>. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Then to find the simplfied equation, find only the variables that remain constant in a group, and only include that.
					</p>

					<p>
						Have a look at the example below.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						<b>Example.</b>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ncontent">
					<p>
						Simplify the function \(f = AB\bar{C}D + A\bar{B}\bar{C}D + \bar{A}\bar{B}CD + \bar{A}BCD\). 
					</p>

					<div>
						<p >
							Take the following karnaugh map - note that we have to split now AB / CD.
						</p>

						<img src="logic/kmap-gr1.png" style="max-width: 100%">

						<p>
							In the red group, A remains constant 1, B changes, C remains consant 0, and D remains constant 1, therefore we get \(A \cdot \bar{C} \cdot D\). Similarly for the blue group, A remains constant 0, B changes, and C, D remain constant 1, therefore we get \(\bar{A} \cdot C \cdot D\).
						</p>
						<p>
							Thus \(f = A \cdot \bar{C} \cdot D + \bar{A} \cdot C \cdot D\)
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div>
					<p class="ir">
						Equivalences.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						It is possible to have equivalent constructions which are all the optimal solution. For example, for the following map:
					</p>

					<img src="logic/kmap-gr2.png" style="max-width: 100%">

					<p>

					</p>

					<img src="logic/kmap-gr3.png" style="max-width: 100%">

						Half bit adder.

				<div>
					<p>
						There are several combinatorial logic ciruits one should know about. First of all, we want to look at adding bits, since addition is very important generally. To start adding bits, we start off with only a half bit adder, where we add \(A, B\) and get a \(\Sigma, \textrm{Carry}\).

						Full bit adder.

						Subtraction with adders.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>

						Since subtraction is nothing but addition of negative numbers, we can use two's complement principle to do this. We have a toggle bit \(M\) which hooks onto \(B\). 
					</p>

					<p>
						To convert a number to two's complement, we flip the bits and add 1, so what we can do is flip all the bits of B if M is 1, and then add on M to fit two's complement. An operation to flip the bits of B when M is 1 is <b>exclusive or</b> (check the truth table). We can now build an \(n\)-bit adder-subtractor.
