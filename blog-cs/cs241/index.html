                        There is no concrete definition, but broadly, an OS is software acting as <i>intermediary</i> between the user and hardware. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The OS is responsible for allocating resources and controlling execution to avoid failures. The structure is usually set up like so: 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        User programs <--> System calls <--> OS <--> Hardware

                        <ul>
                            <li>1st generation systems were primitive, and had no OSs or programming languages.</li>
                            <li>2nd gen. were transistor-based mainframe computers. Programming was done on punch cards, and later assembly, FORTRAN, and COBOL. Jobs were queued in batches, and the outputs printed on paper.</li>
                            <li>3rd gen. in the 60s was where the CPU became faster than I/O devices, thus more time was spent on waiting for I/O than computation. This was a problem since jobs were ran one at a time, so the solution was <i>multiprogramming</i>, where when one job performs I/O, others could use the CPU, and multiple concurrent jobs were stored in memory. A basic OS called <i>Multix</i> was invented to facilitate this. </li>
                            <li>In the 70s OSs got more complex - multiprogramming requires things like memory protection - and so Multix got more and more complicated. To try strip out the baggage, two engineers from Bell Labs designed <i>Unix.</i></li>
                            <li>The 80s brought around personal computers. They came with simple OSs for single users, like MS-DOS, Mac OSX. None supported multiprogramming and the like. Later on networking, file sharing, and GUIs were added later.</li>
                            <li>90s to now are when modern OSs, including mobile OSs, developed.</li>

                        There are two categories, functions directly useful to the user (program execution, I/O operations, file management); and functions beneficial for the system (resource allocation, accouting, security).

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Program execution.</b> Running application programs. The OS must load the program into memory, execute it, and stop the program (normally or not).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>IO Operations.</b> For efficiency and safety applications do not control I/O directly, rather OS controls I/O through device drivers and interrupts. Ensures two programs cannot simultanously access one I/O device.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>File System Management.</b> Programs need to read and write files and directories, which may be subject to permission management.

                        <li>
                            <b>Communications.</b> When one process needs to communicate / work on output from another. May be on the same PC or a different one on the network. Involves shared memory or message passing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Error Handling.</b> Errors can occur in hardware (e.g. power failure), I/O devices (parity error), or software error (<code>segmentation fault</code>) - OS uses error handling software.

                        <li>
                            <b>Resource Allocation.</b> Allocate available resources when multiple users or jobs running concurrently.

                        <li>
                            <b>Protection and Security.</b> Ensure concurrent processes do not interfere with each other or the OS, and protect from outside attacks.

                        The <b>kernel</b> is the core of the OS, loaded at startup, and runs all the time. It contains essential services like memory management, process scheduling, and file management. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kernels run on <i>kernel space</i>, protected from <i>user space</i>. Kernel space can be accessed via <b>system calls</b>.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        When the user requires service from kernel, they invoke a <b>system call</b>, which are low-level functions provided by the OS. They generally can do privileged operations, and are a consistent interface for common operations. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        To distinguish between OS ops and user ops, hardware is set to one of two modes: <i>user</i> and <i>kernel</i> mode. The <b>mode bit</b> indicates said mode, 0/1 for kernel and user. Priveliged instructions can only be performed in kernel mode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the <i>dual mode of operation.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The OS is large and complex, so it is common to break it down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early OSs did not have well-defined structures, to have the most functionality in the least space with the least overhead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In MS-DOS, application programs could access basic I/O routines directly. Unix also had a case of "monolithic kernel" where everything is on the same layer. Little overhead, but a pain to maintain.

                        One approach is to divide the OS into layers, with the lowest level 0 being hardware, and the highest level being the user. Layers inbetween <i>uses</i> services from below, and <i>provides</i> services to above.

                        <b>loadable kernel modules</b>. The kernel implements core services only, and others are <i>dynamically loaded</i> as required.

                    <p>
                        Each kernel section has a well-defined interface, but any module can call any other module. It's similar in concept to microkernel, but there is no message passing overhead back and forth from kernel space.
