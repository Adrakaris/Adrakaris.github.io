				A robot; but specifically, an *embodied* robot that can move, and make its own decisions.

				It takes in input from sensors, and processes those inputs, and sens outputs to components - whether they be for actioning or locomotion.

				Robots have their benefits, like repeatability and reliability, but also their downsides, such as job replacement, cost, and inabilities in certain tasks.

				We want robots to be **autonomous** -- this is different to *automatic*, which is just carrying out present events, but *autonomous* means it can make decisions. Robots vary in autonomy, from the remote-controlled to fully autonomous.

				Robots also have to consider limited processing power, and also energy consumption in their mobile bodies.

				### Introduction

				Sensing three fundamental questions:

				* Where are we? 
				* Where do we want to go?
				* How do we get there?

				Tend towards *probabilistic methods*, as they scale well, but they tend to come with increasing computational complexity to simulate.

				* <a href="#s2">Commonly Used</a>
				* <a href="#sq">Sensing Questions</a>

				### Characterising Sensing 

				The sensing process goes:

				1. **Transducer**: converts the physical/chemical signal into electric 
				2. **Signal Conditioning**: wanting signal to be linear and proportional to detection (amplification may be needed)
				3. **Computer Interface** 
				4. **Data Reduction, Analysis**: data compressed if required, then used
				5. **Perception**: Analysis of models.

				Sensors can be classified based on things:

				* **Internal <--> External** (Proprioceptive <--> Exteroceptive): Either measure internal values, like wheel speed, load, heading, etc. Or measure information about environment, like distances, light, etc. Can be debatable sometimes which one a sensor belongs to.

				* **Passive <--> Active**: Just listening, like light detector. Or actively emitting energy, like radar.

				Other things to consider include:

				* **Bandwidth/Frequency**: the speed of the sensor. Hz. 
				* **Accuracy**: Defined as $1-(\fr{\rm{measured val} - \rm{true val}}{\rm{true val}})$ -- the percentage correctness. The top of that fraction is **error rate**
				* **Precision/Repeatability**: Reliability of results. $\rm{precision} = \fr{\rm{range of values}}{\sigma}$ for stdev sigma.
				* **Resolution**: The smallest possible difference that can be detected. 【例】A sensor range of 5V, stored in 8 bits, would have a resolution of $\fr{5}{2^8} = 0.0195\rm{V} = 19.5\rm{mV}$
				* **Linearity (because we like linear signals)**: Variation of output to input signal. Not as important if data postprocessed.
				* **Sensitivity**: How sensitive sensor is to desired property and how *insensitive* it is to undesired properties. Ratio of output to input change. **Cross sensitivity** is sensitivity to things that actively interfere in your desired thing - e.g. compass and magnets. 
				* **Measurement range**: self explanatory
				* **Power, weight, size, cost.**: self explanatory

				**Calibration** is the process of finding limits, fixing reference points, so that we know what the sensor is measuring.

				### Common Sensors

				***Wheel/Motor encoders.*** wheel has holes in, shine a light beam through, and by counting the number of times the beam is broken in a second, the wheel RPM is found. 

				Can use this to find the distance travelled, *but*-- there will be error if the wheel spins but does not travel, and there will be error from the width of the slats, which can build up a lot. This error decreases with more smaller slats (A, B, C)

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/wheelencoder.png" alt="Wheel encoder">
					<figcaption>Wheel slat configurations</figcaption>
				</figure>

				But often the *quadrature* (D) encoder is used, with two rows offset at 90&deg;, thus giving a better reading and the travel direction.

				<hr>

				***Heading Sensors.*** determine robot orientation and inclination. Can be internal, like a gyroscope, or external, like a compass. 

				This along with velocity can estimate position -- this is **dead reckoning**

				<hr>

				***Accelerometers.*** Various methods. Simplest is a weight with mass $m$ on a spring with constant $k$. When accelerate, displacement $x$ is recorded. Can use $F=ma=kx$ to work out $a$.

				Directional and limited depth of field, but cheap. 

				<hr>

				***Gyroscope.*** Measure and maintain orientation and angular velocity. Degrees per second.

				<hr>

				***Inclinometer.*** Measures inclination (noooo, you don't say?). Two types: **mercury switch** (binary) and **electrolyte sensor** (analogue)

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/tilt.png" alt="Mercury switch: switches on if tilted, binary signal. Electrolyte Sensor: based on level of conductive fluid, provides different signal strength" style="max-width: 500px;">
				</figure>

				<hr>

				All of these can be combined into an **inertial measurement unit** (IMU)

				<hr>

				***Light/Temp Sensor.*** Done with resistors. Photoresistors change resistance to light, and thermal resistors change to heat.

				<hr>

				***Touch Sensor.*** There are two types: Contact (binary isTouching sensor) and tactile (detects the surface shape).

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/touchsensor.png" alt="Whisker sensors: binary touch. Piezoelectric/Tactile sensors: analogue tough" style="max-width: 680px;">
				</figure>

				Whisker sensors/binary sensors are cheaper, but have some limitations and problems. It's not pressure sensitive, and especially for whisker sensors, you must consider *switch bounce*. 

				Tactile sensors use piezoelectric material, whcih changes resistance based on pressure, and so can get shape, force, surface texture, etc.

				<hr>

				***Passive Infra-Red Sensor.*** (PIR) used in motion detectors, monitors two different rays of infra-red light levels next to each other. When a living object passes through the sensor range, there is a heat differential between the two beams, and the sensor will trip.

				<hr>

				***Hall effect sensor.*** Measures external magnetic fields. Can be used with known magnetic fields to infer dstance. 

				### Range Sensors

				Range sensors are very important for mobile robotics, and can be used with internal sensors to calculate position.

				<hr>

				***Time of Flight Ranging.*** (ToF) 

				Sending a signal out, waiting for a bounce back, and getting a range distance, because you know how quick the signal goes.

				Bats do this (echolocation), as well as other **sonar** devices. **Lidar** is also used. 

				Since light is much quicker than sound, it requires more accuracte sensors and computers, and so hobbyist equipment tends to stick to sonar.

				The sensing quality may not be great depending on factors such as angle of facing wall, or interference or other factors.

				<hr>

				***Phase Shift Measurement.*** Measuring difference in wavelength (phase) between a sent and received signal. L	ike the system used to detect gravitational waves. 

				<figure>
					<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269108642/figure/fig1/AS:295434892398592@1447448575200/Laser-rangefinder-principal-scheme.png" alt="Phase shift">
				</figure>

				However, this only works where the distance is less than the wavelength of the beam -- otherwise it just doesn't work, since 360&deg; wavelengths are not able to be told apart.

				<hr>

				***Triangulation ranging.*** Send two beams set a known distance apart to a common target, and use the angles of the beams to calculate the distance. **(important)**

				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/triangulation.png" alt="" style="max-width: 600px;">
					<figcaption>Triangulation Process (Remmber: Sine Rule)</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<hr>

				***Active Infrared.*** Sends out an infrared beam, just below the frequency of ambient infrared. Fairly cheap.

				<hr>

				***Sonar.*** Using ultrasonic sound waves, far above human hearing.

				Speed of sound dependent on temperature and humidity, and so it is really only good at low ranges, up to ~ 5m.

				Very simple to do, but:

				Sound doesn't travel in rays exactly, and you can also get *crosstalk* (interference between different robots / sounds from the environment). It is still ultimately quite slow too, because sound is really not that quick.

				<hr>

				***Radar.*** Does the same as sonar but uses radio signals. They are long range and relatively accurate, but are also supceptible to interference.

				<hr>

				***Laser Rangefinding/Lidar.*** Using laser light. Fast, accurate, but has a limited range to a few hundred metres, is power hungry, and is also *very expensive*. 

				2D lidar is expensive, 3D is even more expensive, but you can imitate a 3D lidar by using a 2D one, and manually moving it perpendicular to the plane it can see in ("Push-broom lidar").

				<b>[3]</b> What are wheel encoders used for? 
			</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Answer... </button>
			<div class="ccontent md-conv">
				A popular device for controlling the position and speed of wheels and other motor-driven parts. Wheel movements can be used to get an estimate of position/distance.

				Simple and widely accessible. 

				However, because they are internal, their estimation of position is in reference frame of the robot and may not best reflect what is actually going on, which may cause errors.

				Take the sine rule: 

				$$ \fr{l_{AB}}{\sin(180^\circ - \alpha - \beta)} = \fr{l_{AC}}{\sin\beta} = \fr{l_{BC}}{\sin\alpha} $$

				Rearranging,

				\begin{align}
					l_{AC} &= \fr{l_{AB} \cdot \sin\beta }{\sin(180^\circ - \alpha - \beta)}\\
					l_{BC} &= \fr{l_{AB} \cdot \sin\alpha }{\sin(180^\circ - \alpha - \beta)}
