			<h2>Type Classes</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="cbox">
			<p>
				Type classes let us overload functions, and restrict polymorphism. For example, <code>(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int</code> is addition over integers, however addition should work for all numbers, so we can create a <code>Num</code> typeclass to allow addition to be defined over all numbers - which are <i>instances</i> of <code>Num</code>.
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Num a where
	(+) :: a -> a -> a
	(-) :: a -> a -> a
	abs :: a -> a
	...</code></pre>

			<p>
				We have method typings defined under the <code>Num</code> TC.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can then define <code>instance Num Int where ...</code> and define all the methods underneath for the integers. 
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Show a where
	show :: a -> String</code></pre>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">instance Show Bool where
	show True = "True"
	show False = "False"</code></pre>

			<p>
				Of course, haskell polymorphism is not the same as OOP polymorphism. There are two main types of polymorphism in java and haskell, which are listed below,
			</p>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Java</th>
					<th>Parametric</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><i>Parametric Polymorphism.</i> Parameters, with generics, like <br><code>class LinkedList&lt;T&gt; { ...</code></td>
					<td><i>Parametric Polymorthism.</i> With type variables, like <br><code>id :: a -> a</code> or <code>head :: [a] -> a</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><i>Subtype polymorphism.</i> Inheritance; <br><code>class Duck extends Bird { ...</code></td>
					<td><i>Ad-hoc polymorphism.</i> Restriction via typeclass, <br><code>(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a</code></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>
				Type classes can have superclasses, for example the <code>Ord</code> (total order) constraint has an <code>Eq</code> superclass;
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Eq a => Ord a where
	(<)  :: a -> a -> Bool
	(<=) :: a -> a -> Bool</code></pre>

			<p>
				Functions that are defined with typeclass constraints are overloaded.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="colourband" id="reasoning">
			<h2>Equational Reasoning</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="cbox">
			<p>
				Since functional programming is pure, we can use formal reasoning to prove the operation of programs. 
			</p>

			<p>
				When we do equational reasoning, we can use {curly brackets} to denote comments.
			</p>

			<button class="collapsible ">Natural Numbers...</button>
			<div class="ccontent ">
				<p>
					<b><i>Natural Numbers.</i></b> Let us define natural numbers as
				</p>
				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">data Nat = Zero
		 | Succ Nat</code></pre>

		 		<p>

		 		</p>

		 		<pre><code class="lang-haskell">add :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
add Zero m = m
add (Succ n) m = Succ (add n m)</code></pre>

				<p>
		 			Let us try to prove the following statement: <code>∀m :: Nat   add Zero m = m</code>. 
		 		</p>

		 		<div class="codediv">add m Zero {known to be true}</div>

		 		<p>
		 			We can prove the statement by induction, given that

		 		<div class="codediv">add Zero Zero = Zero {base case}

add (Succ n) Zero
= {applying add}
  Succ (add n Zero)
= {inductive hypothesis}
  Succ n. □</div>


			</div>


			<p>
				The previous example above is fairly straight forward. Often with reasoning there's either direct application, or proving via induction. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If you can rewrite a statement directly, do it.</li>
				<li>If there are a finite number of values, you can do case analysis</li>
				<li>If there are infinite values, it's a case of induction. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Since proofs here are always \(\Longleftrightarrow\) (even if it's not explicitly denoted), if it is hard to go forward, try starting with the end result and move backwards.

					<li><code>map f (map g xs) == map (f.g) xs => map f (map g (x:xs)) == map (f.g) (x:xs) </code> (Recursive case)</li>

			</div>

			<p>
				There's more equational reasoning, as well as the compiler thing and stuff, but admittedly it is rather beyond me. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="colourband" id="functors">
			<h2>Foldables and Functors</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="cbox">
			<h2>Foldables</h2>

			<p>
				A foldable is defined by the following typeclass
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Foldable t where
	foldr :: (a->b->b) -> b -> t a -> b</code></pre>

			<p>
				Where <code>t a</code> is the foldable type. A foldable (one example of which being a binary tree) is a data structure / container that stores many data, and can be "collapsed down". 
			</p>

			<p>
				<code>t</code> then would be a type that can contain another type, like <code>[a], BinTree a</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<code>foldr</code> takes a function (a to b to b), an initial value b, a "container" t a, and returns the result of type b.
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">instance Foldable BinTree where
	foldr f z Leaf = z
	foldr f z (Node l x r) = f x (foldr f (foldr f z r) l)</code></pre>

			<p>
				This implementation is a postfix (DLR) implementation of folding over binary trees. However, <code>foldable</code>s can generally be derived by the compiler automatically, though you're not allowed to do that in the exam.
			</p>

			<h2>Functors</h2>

			<div class="blue">
			<p>
				A data type <code>f</code> is a functor if there is a function <code>fmap</code> (or <code>(<$>)</code>) <code>:: (a->b -> f a -> f b</code>, and
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>fmap id = id</code></li>
				<li><code>fmap (f.g) = fmap f . fmap g</code></li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			

			<p>
				Basically, <code>f</code> is a container which stores a type, and it's a functor if you can map a function over elements in that container, whilst keeping it in said container form. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Recall <code>map</code>, and note the <code>Maybe</code> data type;
			</p>
			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a</code></pre>

			<p>
				<code>Maybe</code> here is a functor, and lists are also functors, as the follwing definitions show:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">instance Functor [] where
	fmap = map

instance Functor Maybe where
	fmap f (Just x) = Just $ f x
	fmap _ Nothing = Nothing </code></pre>
		</div>

		<div class="colourband" id="applicatives">
			<h2>Applicatives</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="cbox">
			<h2>Kinds and the Either Type</h2>

			<p>
				Kinds are the types of types. Similar to the <code>expression :: type</code> notation, we have <code>type :: kind</code> <i>"kinding"</i>, however kinding is rarely written. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The most important kind is <code>Type</code>, or <code>*</code>. Simple types have a kind of just <code>*</code>, however types that take constructors, such as <code>[a]</code>, has a kind of <code>[] :: * -> *</code>, same with <code>Maybe</code>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Recall how functors are written like <code>f a</code>, thus all functors should have kind <code>f :: * -> *</code>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<code>Maybe</code> can be used to propagate an error case (with <code>Nothing</code>), however it is not very descriptive. Thus, we have an <code>Either</code> type, with a kind of <code>* -> * -> *</code>, and is defined
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">data Either e a = Left e | Right a</code></pre>

			<p>
				<code>Left</code> binds stronger than <code>Right</code>, and is used as an error case, but allows one to specify an error code (with custom data types).
			</p>

			<p>
				<code>Either</code> is an instance of Functor, however since <code>Either</code> is of kind <code>* -> * -> *</code>, and functors must be of kind <code>* -> *</code>, we have to specify the first argument and treat <code>Either e</code> as one block. Thus,
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">instance Functor (Either e) where
	-- it is often useful to write the specific type signature when defining;
	-- fmap :: (a->b) -> (Either e) a -> (Either e) b  
	fmap f (Left x) = Left x  -- the "Nothing" case
	fmap f (Right y) = Right $ f y  -- the "f a" case</code></pre>

			<h2>Applicative Functors</h2>

			<p>
				Some type <code>f</code> of kind <code>* -> *</code> is an <b>applicative functor</b> if it is a functor, and there exists a function of type <code>f (a->b) -> f a -> f b</code>. Thus, along with <code>$, <$></code> there is also
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell"><*> :: Applicative f => f (a->b) -> f a -> f b</code></pre>

			<div class="side">
				
			
			<p>
				Thus the <b>applicative class</b> is defined as follows,
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Functor f => Applicative f where
	pure :: a -> f a
	(<*>) :: f (a->b) -> f a -> f b   -- "apply"</code></pre>
			</div>
			<p>
				Think of <code><*></code> as an operator that applies a function stored in a container to a value stored in another container of the same type, and keeps the result in the container. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It is often handy when applying a function <code>do :: a -> b -> c</code> to multiple arguments, all inside Applicatives (i.e. <code>f a, f b</code>), to do <code>do <$> f a <*> f b</code>, since the first operation would yield a curried function <code>(do a) :: b -> c</code> inside the container f.
			</p>

			<div class="blue">
			<p>
				<b><i>Applicative Laws.</i></b> An instance of Applicative must also follow all applicative laws, those being
			</p>
			
				<ul>
					<li><code>pure id <*> x = x</code></li>
					<li>
						<code>pure f <*> pure x = pure (f x)</code><br>
						<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m <*> pure y = pure ($ y) <*> m</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				<code>Maybe, Either</code> are all instances of Applicative, and for example <code>Maybe</code> is defined as follows:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">instance Applicative Maybe where
	pure = Just
	Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
	(Just f) <*> x = f <$> x</code></pre>

			<p>
				There are also the rather weird operations <code><*</code> and <code>*></code>, which (seem to) take two Applicatives, and discard either the first or second entirely, however they keep error cases. They are defined as follows (along with the <code>const</code> function):
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">const :: a -> b -> a
const x _ = x

(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
x <* y = const <$> x <*> y

(*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b
x *> y = flip const <$> x <*> y</code></pre>

			<p>
				From this <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5836640/are-there-human-friendly-names-for-applicative-and-friends-methods">StackOverflow Post</a>, it seems that <code>*></code> is called "ignored" and <code><*</code> is called "ignoring".
			</p>

			<p>
				So this is all well and good, but there are some things to bear in mind.
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">	Just 4 <* Nothing
==> const <$> Just 4 <*> Nothing
==> Just (const 4) <*> Nothing
==> Nothing.  -- even when "Ignoring" since we have a Nothing argument we get Nothing.</code></pre>
			
			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">	Just 4 *> Just 8
==> flip const <$> Just 4 <*> Just 8
==> Just (flip const 4 8)
==> Just 8.</code></pre>

			<p>
				The <b>unit type</b> is <code>() :: ()</code>. <code>()</code> is the sole value. It is also an empty tuple.
			</p>

			<p>
				Take <code>f <$> as <*> bs <*> cs</code>, if the applicatives were <i>lists</i>, this would be the same as <code>[f a b c | a <- as, b <- bs, c <- cs]</code>.
			</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Example: Random Numbers...</button>
			<div class="ccontent">
				<p>
					<b><i>Random Numbers.</i></b> Random numbers are, by definition, random, and in a pure language we can't have something be undeterminable, so how do we do it when we want random numbers? (Well, first, they're <i>pseudo</i>random, but still)
				</p>

				<p>
					In Haskell we have the package <code>System.Random</code>. Within, we have the following:
				</p>

				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">StdGen :: *  -- this is a basic type
MkStdGen :: Int -> StdGen  -- this is a type constructor
next :: StdGen -> (Int, StdGen)</code></pre>

				<p>
					So with the basic <code>next</code> function and a <code>StdGen</code> (which is like a pseudorandom generator class). However if we wanted two random numbers, then we'd have to do something like
				</p>

				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">twoRandomNumbers :: StdGen -> ((Int, Int), StdGen)
twoRandomNumbers rng = ((x, y), rng'')
	where (x, rng')  = next rng
		  (y, rng'') = next rng'</code></pre>

				<p>
					However this is rather clumsy of an implementation, and not very generalisable. So let us redo it whilst using a new <code>State</code> type that we make.
				</p>

				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">-- State is of kind * -> * -> *
data State s a = St (s -> (a, s))

-- we also have an accompanying function
runState :: State a s -> s -> (a, s)
runState (St m) = m</code></pre>

				<p>
					Yep, it's what it looks like; the data type State stores a <i>function</i>. The runState function thus extracts the function from the State data type. 
				</p>

				<p>
					It represents a computation of the initial state s, to give a result of type a and the "next" or resulting state s. <code>State</code> here is an <i>applicative functor.</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					We can "clean up" our random number functions with State as follows
				</p>

				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">randomNumber :: State StdGen Int
randoNumber = St next

twoRandomNumbers :: State StdGen (Int, Int)
twoRandomNumbers = mkPair <$> randomNumber <*> randomNUmber
	where mkPair a b = (a, b)</code></pre>

				<p>
					Note that these are no longer <i>functions</i> but rather just <i>definitions</i>, there's no arrows going on. However, random numbers can still be extracted by <code>runState</code>ing the <code>twoRandomNumbers</code> with an initial seed. 
				</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				<i>"A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's so hard about that?"</i>
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose we have a basic programming language and intepreter defined in Haskell. <code>Expr</code> is the expression to evaluate, and we have a function <code>eval</code> which will return an evaluated value.
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">data Expr = Val Int
		  | Add Expr Expr
		  | Div Expr Expr

eval :: ??</code></pre>

		  	<p>
		  		We want to write eval such that we don't get a runtime error when we divide by zero, so perhaps it would be prudent to use a safe division function. 
		  		<pre><code class="lang-haskell">safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int</code></pre>

		  		Which will return <code>Nothing</code> if we try to divide by zero.
		  	</p>

		  	<p>
		  		We can then use this safeDiv function to write eval, however the following looks good at a glance, but does not typecheck:
		  	</p>

		  	<pre><code class="lang-haskell">eval :: Expr -> Maybe Int
eval (Val n) = Just n
eval (Add l r) = (+) <$> eval l <*> eval r  -- Need to use apply over maybes
eval (Div l r) = safeDiv <$> eval l <*> eval r</code></pre>

		  	<p>
		  		This is because of the last line, which will make the compiler throw up an error. When we do <code>eval l</code> and <code>eval r</code>, we'll get <code>Maybe x</code> and <code>Maybe y</code> let's say, to use some unknowns x and y. Then, when we try to apply safeDiv over the two, we would get <code>Maybe (safeDiv x y)</code> which will be of type <code>Maybe(Maybe Int)</code>. Ah. 
		  	</p>

			<p>
				Let's introduce a function called <code>bind</code> to solve this, which is often written as <code>>>=</code>. It can be defined for Maybe as the following:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">(>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
(>>=) Nothing _ = Nothing
(>>=) (Just x) f = f x</code></pre>
			
			<p>
				This lets us write our code in a way that actually works, that is as follows;
				<pre><code class="lang-haskell">eval (Div l r) = eval l >>= (\x -> eval r >>= (\y -> x `safeDiv` y))</code></pre>
				You don't actually need the brackets, and convention is to have a new line after the arrow, however I've put in brackets so you can see what is an argument of what.
			</p>

			<h2>The Monad Class</h2>

			<p>
				What we have just done is defined and used the essential function in the Monad class. 
			</p>

			<div class="side">
			<p>
				Monads are subclasses of applicative functors, and are defined as follows:
			</p>

			<pre><code class="lang-haskell">class Applicative m => Monad m where
	(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

	return :: a -> m a
	return = pure</code></pre>

			<p class="small">
				<i>"return" is just a legacy from when Monads and Applicatives were not so linked.</i>
			</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				It is of kind <code>* -> *</code>
			</p>

			<div class="blue">
				<p>
				<b><i>Monad Laws.</i></b> Monads also have laws they must follow.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The <i>left identity</i>: <code>pure x >>= f = f x</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					The <i>right idenity</i>: <code>m >>= pure = m</code>
				</li>
				<li>
					The <i>associativity rule</i>: <code>(m >>= f) >>= y</code>  \(\equiv\)  <code>m >>= (\x -> f x >>= y)</code>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p></p>

			<button class="collapsible">Monad Helper Functions...</button>
			<div class="ccontent">
				<p>
					Monads have helper functions in <code>Control.Monad</code>, some of which are listed below.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]</code></li>
					<li><code>void :: Functor f => f a -> f ()</code></li>
					<li><code>join :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a</code></li>
					<li><code>replicateM :: Applicative f => Int -> f a -> f [a]</code></li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p>
				Since binds have a rather inconvenient notation, monads in haskell come with <b>do-notation</b>, which is a very <i>imperative</i> notation for monad binding. A <code>do</code> statement opens the block, and within <code>x <- code</code> is the equivalent of binding, with x being the computation the result of the code is bound to. 
			</p>

			<p>
				A <code>do</code> block will run all the way to the end regardless, and so <code>return</code> or <code>pure</code> won't stop the running of the block, unlike an imperative return. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that the error case is bound more strongly than the normal case, so if a <code><-</code> bind encounters a <code>Nothing</code> or a <code>Left e</code> (of an Either monad - did I mention Either is also a monad?) it will immediately return the error and not consider subsequent lines. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To demonstrate, here's some example code.
