<p class="subheading">Version 4.0</p>

<div class="cbox">
<div class="md-conv">

Draconic is the language of the dragons in the Material Plane, originating around the Spring of the Earth. It comes in two main dialects: eastern and western, *rékharhákr* and *rkaarik*, with limited intelligibility between them. There is also the ancient literary form of the language “*hakr*”, which is only preserved for highly formal and religious occasions, and is generally not known by outsiders.

*This is the fourth major iteration of draconic which contains breaking changes with previous versions and previous documents.*

## Sounds <span id="sounds"></span>

Draconic did not originally have a native writing system of its own; in the east users generally wrote in logographic Yan seal script characters, whilst in the west it remained a spoken-only language until the first age of dragonkind, when a simple alphabet—abjad script was created in the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, formed of simple letters easily written or carved by claw. This later spread eastwards, and is in informal use both to write draconic and also to represent the sounds of the Yan languages.

Footnotes: 
- 【1】*h* and *kh* are pronounced the same, but the former is high pitch, and the latter is low pitch.
- 【2】In eastern draconic, this is only pronounced /f/ in *final* place, and /v/ everywhere else. Some accents do not separate the sounds. In western draconic, /f/ and /v/ are distinct but written the same.
- 【3】Usually /s/ with a low pitch, very rarely /θ/ and only then generally western dialects. Contrasts with *s* which is high pitch.
- 【4】Apostrophes indicate omitted letters and syllable demarcations where ambiguous

*Long vowels* are written using reduplicated vowel letters *aa, ee, ii, oo, uu*, however of these only *aa, ii* are common. This elongates the vowel sound but does not change its quality significantly. Vowel diphthongs include *ai* /aɪ/ and *ie* /ie/,

Draconic generally has a (CC)V(CC) structure, with ancient draconic having more of a (CCC)(V)(CCC) with some words (e.g. “*thr*”, water) having no (or rather very unstressed) vowels.

Also in ancient draconic, the merged sounds *h*, *kh*, *s*, and *th* are different in quality, being softer and harsher respectively, but this is generally difficult to hear, and modern readers will usually obey pitch accent rules.

### Spelling <span id="spelling"></span>

Draconic spelling is generally very regular, as it was never fossilised. In modern draconic romanisation can be mapped to draconic letters exactly in a many-to-one fashion, e.g. 

> *othalon* → O Th A L O N    
> *vathas* → F A Th A S

*Stress* is always placed on long vowels if they exist, and if not usually on the first syllable of a word. However, accent marks can be used to indicate which syllables are stressed, and can be useful for disambiguation:

> *asiir* → Asyr Shai; *ásiir* → the sun 

*Pitch accent* (explained later) is not shown, but is regular, and a result of merged sounds. 

All varieties of draconic exhibit “*s-dropping*”, where a grammatical final-s is replaced with a glottal stop. Final s however is always written.

> *kains* (liked) → /k<sup>h</sup>aɪnʔ/  (conjugated *s*)
> *váthas* (depths) → /vasas/ or /vasa/ or /vasa:/

### Alphabet <span id="alphabet"></span>

The draconic alphabet is called the *akron*, after its first five letters. Each letter is given a name of a word beginning with it. There is no minuscule and majuscule script.

|Letter|Name|Meaning|Letter|Name|Meaning|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |

### Yan Characters <span id="yan-characters"></span>

Speakers of eastern draconic exhibit an extreme case of diglossia, where draconic is spoken between speakers informally, but the literary Yan language (== *classical chinese*) is used for almost all formal documentation. Characters can also be used to write draconic, especially ancient draconic, in a mostly 1:1 semantic correspondence.

<h1 id="Rekharhakr">Rekharhakr</h1>
<p class="subheading">High Draconic</p>

<div class="cbox">
<div class="md-conv">

*High Draconic* or Eastern Draconic is the dialect of draconic spoken in Eastern Aseron and sparsely in the eastern reaches of Parsor. Draconic grammar and speech will be primarily described using this dialect, with differences highlighted for other dialects spoken.

## Pitch Accent  <span id="pitch-accent"></span>

Draconic has a pitch accent, due the general merger of the _h_,_kh_ and _s_,_th_ sounds. In general, syllables can have two accents: **high** (or flat) and **low**. These can also be marked by the Chinese characters 平 and 去.

_h_ and _s_ are **high** accent letters, and are read with the default high accent, contoured (33). However, due to final -s dropping a final -s does not affect the accent of a syllable.

_kh_ and _th_ are **low** accent, contoured (21) or (11).

All other syllables can be called **non-accented**, and have a high tone by default, but can be affected by the syllables around them. Some accents have different quality depending on the preceding syllable accent.

Note that since minimal accent pairs are relatively few, mis-accenting a word tends not to cause communication issues.

Full details of pitch transformations is shown below:

|Previous syllable|This syllable|Accent rules|Contours|
|---|---|---|---|
|High|High|-|A˧ B˧|
|Low|High|Accent previous as (11) even if it begins a word|A˩ B˦|
|None|High|-|A˧ B˧|
|High|Low|Pronounce this with higher falling contour (31)|A˧ B˧˩|
|Low|Low|Pronounce this with flat low contour (21) or (11)|A˨˩ B˩|
|None|Low|If previous is _stressed_, treat as high. If previous is _unstressed_, treat as low.|A˧ B˧˩ or A˩ B˨˩|
|High|None|-|A˧ B˧|
|Low|None|Pronounce this as low|A˧˩ B˩|
|None|None|(Optional) often pronounced as falling (32), can also be high.|A˧ B˧ or A˧ B˧˨|

## Grammar  <span id="grammar"></span>

#### Word Order <span id="word-order"></span>
General word order is Subject-Verb-Object or Topic-Comment as in Chinese. Passive voice is very similar to topic-comment structure, but any subject is replaced with the copula BE verb. 

> *aa triin thúrgar* — 3Pn EAT FISH — They eat fish    
> *thúrgar, aa triin* — FISH, 3Pn EAT — The fish, they ate it  
> *thúrgar siin triin* — FISH BE EAT — The fish is eaten

Rekharhakr is generally head-initial, and adjectives are placed after nouns. The formal order is: qualifier; proper adjective; colour; shape; age; size; quality. The same follows for adverbs as adverbs and adjectives are not differentiated.

> *rekhár khrae* — DRAGON RED — Red dragon

However, in compound words — where two separate words are joined to make a new meaning — the main noun generally goes at the end.

> *rekháridiks* — Dragonkind — lit. *rekhar* DRAGON *idiks* RACE

#### Adjectives and Adverbs <span id="adjectives_and_adverbs"></span>

There is no difference seen between adjectives and adverbs, other than that one goes after nouns and the other after verbs. Adjectives have no special word forms, and do not conjugate (apart from specific modifiers which are detailed in *Conjugation*). 

For the most part nouns can be used as adjectives to describe things that are like the noun, or of the noun. However, in some cases this may not make sense and the reverse is not true — adjectives generally cannot be used as nouns. Especially for literary reasons, “word inversion”, where a compound word is broken and the order put into head initial order is common.

> *idiks rekhár* — RACE DRAGON — dragonkind (word inverted)

#### Articles
There are no articles in rekharhakr draconic. Pluralisation is also implied. Number and quantity are generally placed before the noun, but can also be placed after as an adjective (this is rare).

> *yir hákros* — ONE MOUNTAIN — A mountain 

#### Pronouns <span id="pronouns"></span>
Rekharhakr has the following pronouns for first and second person:

- *zar* or *za* first person pronoun 
- *zii* second person (informal)
- *záhar* second person (formal)

For third person pronouns, rekharhakr uses both gendered and non-gendered-generic pronouns, as well as a fourth pronoun for non-people (“lower-class”), much like the English “it”. However, this pronoun can be used for sentient beings such as other non-dragon races in an informal or disrespectful capacity.

- *aa* third person generic pronoun 
- *aak* third person male pronoun 
- *khaa* third person female pronoun
- *thaa* third person lower-class pronoun

#### Conjugation <span id="conjugation"></span>
Rekharhakr is very isolating with limited conjugation for tense and other modifiers, which generally do not change for case or person. 

The **possessive** particle *-on* is placed on the possessor with no modification to the word. The exception is for the first person pronoun *zar* and the second person informal pronoun *zii*, where *zaron* and *zii’on* is usually contracted to *ron* and *zin* respectively.

> *khaaron draniir* — 3Pn-FEMALE-Poss WISDOM — Her wisdom

Adding a possessive may shift syllable stress in certain cases, such as *xíron* “Xiron” becoming *xirónon* “of Xiron”.

The **actor** particle *-ark* is placed after a verb to subjectify it into an actor of that verb. It is similar to -er in English.

The **group** particle *-ad* can be placed on a pronoun or a noun to show a group of something, similar to 们 in modern standard chinese. This is not used to show plurals and for standard nouns often appears only in subject place. Hence *zar* “I” can be made *zarad* “we (exclusive)”, *aak* “he” can be made *aakad* “they (masculine)”.

Where the given word ends in a single *a*, the effect of adding a group elongates this into a double *aa*. If the word ends in a double *aa*, then only a *d* is suffixed. Hence *aa* “they (singl)” can be made *aad* “they (plur)”.

The **negation** particle *dia* “not” can be put *before* a verb to negate it. This is often shortened to the prefix *d-*. Before certain consonants (and vowels), the *d-* prefix changes the quality of the consonant afterwards:

| original         | transformed | original | transformed |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| *da* (not *daa*) | *dia*       | *dx*     | *zx*        |
| *dk*             | *dkh*       | *dm*     | *dv*        |
| *dn*             | *dan*       | *dl*     | *dr*        |
| *dd*             | *vd*        | *dp*     | *dv*        |
| *dt*             | *dz*        | *dg*     | *dig*       |

#### Verbs <span id="verbs"></span>
All verbs have a root and an infinitive ending of *in*, except some irregular verbs (though some irregular verbs do end with *in*). Nouns ending in *in* should not be confused for verbs. 

Verbs conjugate to represent tense by changing the suffix, and generally do not conjugate based on person. The below shows conjugation for regular verbs. 

| Tense                        | Guide and Example                                                                                                                                 | ‘in      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Inf/Present                  | Present tense keeps the infinitive ending.<br>*Aak paziin* / He plays                                                                             | *in*     |
| Past                         | Add an *s* on the end. This past is the generic ‘past tense’<br>*Aak paxiins* / He played                                                         | *ins*    |
| Past imperfect /  pluperfect | Add *ir* on the end. This is generally used for pluperfect only.<br>*Aak paziinir* / He had played                                                | *inir*   |

| Condl/past future            | Replace *in* with *ixa*.<br>*Aak paziixa* / He would play                                                                                         | *ixa*    |
| Imperative                   | Replace *in* with *ii*. If the verb ends in *iin*, remove the *n*.<br>*Pazii nal za* / Play with me. (informal) Remove in completely: Paz nal za. | *ii* / - |

*Note:* Some regular verbs on an irregular basis end with another vowel and *n* — these conjugate the same unless explicitly mentioned.

#### Modal Verbs <span id="modal-verbs"></span>
Modal verbs, like “can”, “may”, etc. generally are single syllable words that do not conjugate. These include 
- *kat* — can / to be able to 
- *iir* — may / to be permitted to
- *os* — must / to be obligated to
- *has* — shall 
- *sis* — will / to be willing to (not used for generic future)

#### Irregular Verbs <span id="irregular-verbs"></span>

Irregular verbs are:

> *siin* (to be); *yaar* (to have); *komán* (to come); *asrai’ín* (to fly); *xirín* (to live); *naden* (to see)

#### The Copula <span id="the-copula"></span> 
The copula “to be” is *siin* in the present tense, however the copula is almost never used in draconic, usually only for auxillary functions. To say that A is B, the two nouns are put next to each other. *siin* can also be used for affirmations in colloquial speech.

> *aak rekhár* — 3Pn-MALE DRAGON — He is a dragon 

*siin* is also optional at the end of comments in topic-comment sentences as a comment marker, where it is usually in the reduced form as *sin* which is never stressed.

> *thúrgar, aak triin sin* — FISH, 3Pn EAT Comment — The fish, they ate it

#### Relative Pronouns <span id="relative-pronouns"></span>
An example of a relative pronoun is the “who” in “he _who_ lights a fire”. Relative pronouns in rekharhakr can be constructed in two forms, either by repeating the pronoun in question, or by using a topic comment sentence with mandatory comment marker. 

> *aak, aak anavín yíra* — 3Pn-MALE, 3Pn-MALE LIGHT FIRE — He who lights a fire    
> *aak, anavín yíra sin* — 3Pn-MALE, LIGHT FIRE Comment — He who lights a fire

#### Honorifics <span id="honorifics"></span>
Proper nouns are given no significance in writing, however an underline on the bottom (horizontal text) or right (vertical text) side can be used to indicate names. Honorifics are placed after a person’s name:

> *astron arkhan, maa taikhán, lurkhái khan* — Astron LORD, Ma DUKE, Lurkhai KING — Lord Astron, Duke Ma, King Lurkhai

### Sample Text <span id="sample-text"></span>

**Spellbound - Emily Bronté**     
*Maskafín - Emilii Pronté*

The night is darkening round me, / *xarái kiisin yúrir za,*     
The wild winds coldly blow; / *ervís mae arák vusiin,*     
But a tyrant spell has bound me / *ir maks yirsáre sávans za;*     
And I cannot, cannot go. / *a za dkhat, dkhat vahín.*     

The giant trees are bending / *kanán lutáin ligárin,*     
Their bare boughs weighed with snow. / *kladi kálgen mer mars zigrín*.     
And the storm is fast descending, / *a kaatai komán xyae,*     
And yet I cannot go. / *ir sa, za dkhat vahín.*     

Clouds beyond Clouds above me, / *asúr aratái háva,*     
Wastes beyond wastes below, / *táikhadir váth siia,*     
But nothing drear can move me; / *ir dakh maan xilyín za;*     
I will not, cannot go. / *zar sis dia, kat dia, vahín.*

<p class="subheading">Western Draconic</p>

<div class="cbox">

*Rkaarik* is the western dialect of draconic, spoken in Dacrame and most of western and southern Parsor. It is generally similar to eastern draconic, with some changes in vocabulary and more verb forms, as well as some more differentiated sounds. This section will detail differences with *rekharhakr*.

Certain words carry influences from Rivenian, Elyrian and other western languages. 

## Sound Changes  <span id="sound-changes"></span>

*Rkaarik* has a new sound: *xh* /ʃ/, which is represented by the digraph XH. The sounds /f/ and /v/ *are* different in speech, although still written by the same letter. 

*Rkaarik* generally lacks a pitch accent, instead the two merged pairs *h, kh* and *s, th* are somewhat differentiated.
- *h* is a slightly gentler growl than *kh*, although the two are starting to merge, resulting in some tonogenesis in native speakers (dragons) and a pure merger in literary users (non-dragons who require knowledge for history, administration, or other reasons)
- *s* is a slightly sharper hiss than *th*, although literary users are starting to use thorn /θ/ to pronounce the letter *th*.

Literary users will also tend to pronounce final-s sounds

The alphabet is the same, although letter names are slightly different:

|Letter|Name|Meaning|Letter|Name|Meaning|

|A <span class="draconic">A a</span>	|*axhiir*|sun|U	<span class="draconic">U u</span>	|*uhiri*|bird|

## Grammar <span id="grammar"></span>

#### Word order and Articles <span id="word-order-and-articles"></span>

*Rkaarik* is **head-final**: adjectives and adverbs come *before* the noun or verb in question. Head-initial form is still valid in literary contexts. Topic-comment sentences constructed the same.

Articles similarly do not exist, but are slowly appearing in speech, as prefix *t’* for the definite article and *k’* for the indefinite article become more prevalent and inconsistent consonant shifts due to it appear within sublects. These are however not written down.

#### Conjugation and Tenses <span id="conjugation-and-tenses"></span>

The actor particles *-as, -ak, -ask* are all valid in place of *-ark* in *rekharhakr*.

Verbs generally end in *-in, -en,* and *-an*, and irregular verbs also exist to a lesser extent. Generally, if a verb is irregular in *rkaarik*, it is irregular in *rekharhakr*, but some irregular verbs in *rekharhakr* has been regularised.

| Tense                | ‘*in*  | ‘*en*  | ‘*an*  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Inf/Present          | *in*   | *en*   | *an*   |
| Past imperfect       | *ins*  | *ens*  | *ans*  |
| Past perf/pluperfect | *inir* | *enir* | *i*    |
| Future               | *ix*   | *enk*  | *ah*   |
| Condl/past future    | *ixa*  | *enix* | *anix* |
| Imperative           | *ii*   | *er*   | *ai*   |

#### Irregular Verbs <span id="irregular-verbs"></span>

Irregular verbs are *siin, yaar, komán, asra’ín, xirén*.

## History and Writing <span id="history-and-writing"></span>

The ancient spoken form of draconic as it was during and before the first Age of Dragonkind. It had no writing system, as the dragon clans saw no need for writing.

Later, as ideas of state and kingdom permeated through the clans, along with the realisation that rule, taxation, and trade monopoly may be an easier way of amassing wealth than plunder, many of them coalesced into small nations, often deep within the mountains, ruling over other races. These nations generally took on the writing system of whatever culture group they merged into, with the Kingdom of Yan adopting a form of central plains seal script, and the clans of Parsor using the primitive Parsii alphabet.

The latter evolved into an alphabet (read: abjad) specifically for draconic, and as it was first written, only consonants, long vowels, and initial strong vowels were represented. All others were left to be inferred, and in some cases were so weak that modern classical draconic still lacks any definite vowel. 

When writing in this way, vowel digraphs are represented using other letters:

| Modern digraph | Ancient letter(s) |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| *ai*           | F (V) <e-drac>F</e-drac>|
| *ae*           | Y  <e-drac>Y</e-drac> |
| *ie*           | Y  <e-drac>Y</e-drac> |
| *ua*           | R  <e-drac>R</e-drac> |
| *i’a*          | I A   <e-drac>IA</e-drac>  |

*note:* only the first two are proper vowel diphthongs, all other vowel pairs are generally pronounced separately and not as one sound.

> *hakr* — language — H K R [ <e-drac>HKR</e-drac> ] — now written H A K R [ <e-drac>HAKR</e-drac> ]     
> *asiir* — Asyr — A S I R [ <e-drac>ASIR</e-drac> ] — now written A S I I R [ <e-drac>ASIIR</e-drac> ]     
> *(a)srain* — to Fly — S R F N [ <e-drac>SRFN</e-drac> ] — now written S R A I N [ <e-drac>SRAIN</e-drac> ]

> *khro sar salk’ns zo dir* — A time when heaven separated from earth — Kh R | S R | S L K N S | Z | D R [ <e-drac>KHR SR SLKNS Z DR</e-drac> ]

However, modern writers of classical draconic using the draconic alphabetical script generally write it according to modern convention (only omitting the weak vowels) 

## Grammar and Sounds <span id="grammar-and-sounds"></span>

Classical Draconic has the concept of “weak vowels”, which are written in romanisation in brackets — *(a)srain* (to fly) — weak vowels are **never** stressed and often not pronounced altogether, or barely enunciated. Weak vowels are not written even in modern alphabetical writing form.

Many words which have split or gained vowels in modern forms of draconic lack them in classical draconic, leading to a more terse language, but one with significantly more “difficult” consonant clusters. 

Other words have branched into multiple modern words to disambiguate meaning.

Ancient grammar generally tracks that of eastern draconic, but word functions are much less clear. There are no explicit verbs — rather the verb ending is *-n*, which can generally be added to the end of any noun to “verb” it. The past tense verb ending is *-s* which comes after *-n*, and there is no explicit future or conditional marker, leading to time being required to differentiate. 

*Classical Draconic also closely tracks the grammar and writing style of Classical Chinese, being especially terse in nature.*
