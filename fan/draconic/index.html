				High draconic, the language of the dragons of Aseron, originating around the Spring of the Earth and the desert sands. 
				
				Whilst the dragons of the central plains subsumed into its greater culture, and used the human logographic script to write their ancient language, an alphabetical/abjad draconic script came about in Parsor, which is simple and able to be easily written by claw.
				
				In draconic romanisation capital letters are usually omitted, due to the lack of majuscule and minuscule<sup>1</sup>. Proper nouns are occasionally represented in red, except in the central plains where this is seen as inauspicious.

				* 【1】Note that in western draconic there is minuscule, and so minuscule is shown in the alphabet. This is only used in Dacrame.

				* 【1】*v* is a /f/ sound in **final** place, and usually a /v/ everywhere else. Some other dialects will maintain /v/ and /f/ distinction in all cases, though there is no difference in the script.
				* 【2】*th* can also be written as *ss* but this is not common.
				* 【3】An apostrophe can be used to indicate omitted letters and syllable demarcations when otherwise it would be ambiguous.
				* Other double vowels are long vowels. 
				* An accent marker may be used to indicate **stress**. Stress is almost always placed on **long vowels** unless indicated otherwise (e.g. *as**ii**r* vs ***á**siir*).
				
				### Alphabet 
				
				The alphabet is called the *akron*, due to the first five letters. Each letter has its own name.

				### Yan Characters
				
				Yan characters (*yanark*) has been used for thousands of years to write old draconic, which had been done before the *akron* alphabet came from the west.
				
				Afterwards, *yanark* was still use for formal and general writing, whilst *akron* was used informally, and also used by the non-draconic populations to represent sounds in their own languages.
				
				## Grammar 
				
				### Articles
				
				Definite and indefinite articles are omitted in rekharhakr, as well as pluralisation. Numbering and quantity related articles are generally placed before the noun (*ka hakros* / One mountain) though may be occasionally placed after as an adjective (*hakros kaa* / One mountain).
				
				### Proper Nouns and Honorifics
				
				Proper nouns are given no significance in rekharhakr, and are written without majuscule or minuscule. It is acceptable to change the formatting to give significance. Honorifics are placed after a person’s name, such as (*asra khan* / Queen Asra) or (*astron arkhan* / Lord Astron).
				
				### Word Order
				
				Rekharhakr is generally head-initial, and adjectives are placed after nouns, (*rekhar khrae* / red dragon). Adjectives appear with the order: (Quantity), Qualifier, Proper adjective, Colour, Shape, Age, Size, Quality, in that order after the noun. 
				
				Speech is Subject-Verb-Object. In passive voice, Object-Auxiliary-Verb is used, with tense conjugation placed on the auxiliary verb. (*aak triins asiir* / He ate (the) sun) in active voice vs (*asiir siins triin* / The sun was eaten) in the passive voice. In writing, Subject-Object-Verb is used, but O,SV can also be used. (*aak asiir triins* / He, (the) sun ate) or (*asiir, aak triins* / (The) sun, he ate). The rules are fairly fluid, especially in literature, and as long as one can tell a distinct {O, S, V} phrase then it is passable.
				
				The verb to be (*siin*) is not used generally as a standalone verb, only as an auxiliary verb or imperative form. To say that A is B, they are put next to each other, as in AB. (*aak rekhar* / He (is a) dragon). However, in colloquial speech (*siin*) is often used, especially for agreement or questioning. 
				
				There is a case in English where sentences are formed using a “(pro)noun, who”, such as “he who lights a fire.” In draconic, this is written by repeating the (pro)noun in question, as well as using SOV in the following clause, which also applies to sentences like “that, which”. (*aak, aak yira anafin* / he, he a fire lights)
				
				### Negation
				
				The word not can be put after a verb like an adverb to negate it. (*komii dis!* / Don’t come!). The same rule applies to auxiliary verbs, like can or will, but contractions are often used to shorten them (*kat dis* / Can not) vs (*dkhat* / Can’t).
				
				### Other
				
				Emphasis can be done through the use of very after an adjective, or through repeating that adjective twice. The latter is used more in poetry and literature, and both are used equally in general speech.
				
				### Conjugations and Tenses
				
				In the genitive case, ‘*on* is placed on the subject of the possession. (*kharon draniir* / her wisdom) In the case of my, (*zaron*), this is generally too many syllables and is shortened down to just (*ron*). This can change the stressed vowel, and shift it back a syllable, such as (*xíron* / Xiron) to (*xirónon* / Xiron’s).
				
				Group pronouns use the group modifier, ‘*ad*. (*zarad* / we) or (*aakad* / them (masc.))
				
				When talking about a person who does this, such as dancer, or writer, generally ‘*ark* is placed instead of ‘*in*. (*korark* / dancer)
				
				### Verb Tenses
				
				Infinitive verbs have a root, and end with ‘in. Some nouns may also end with ‘in, though this is rare. However, no verbs end with something other than ‘in. Verbs that end with ‘iin or ‘ain or something similar, should generally be treated the same as all other verbs.
				
				<table class="gb"><tr><th>Tense</th><th>Guide and Example</th><th>‘in</th></tr><tr><td>Inf/Present</td><td>Present tense keeps the infinitive ending.<br>*Aak paziin* / He plays</td><td>*in*</td></tr><tr><td>Past imperfect</td><td>Add an *s* on the end.

				## Mutual Intelligibility
				
				Western (or low) draconic evolved over time in Dacrame, as the link between the two continents waned. Western draconic developed its own style, and has more influences from Rivenian and Velyrian, whereas Rekharhakr has remained more pure, with slight influences from Yan Asyrian. They differ mostly in vocabulary, but over twenty millenia vocabulary has diverged significantly enough to make intelligibility somewhat low. 
				
				An example of a different word is the word for I: *zar/za* in High Draconic, and *vos* in Low Draconic.
				
				## Romanisation and Alphabet
				
				The romanisation for western draconic is practically identical, though kharakar distinguishes /f/ from /v/, whereas rekharhakr does not, and they are treated as different sounds. This is however not differentiated in the draconic script, and is treated as the same letter. Sometimes this letter is said as *fathas*, sometimes *vos*, or sometimes both together. 
				
				There is also the ‘sh’ /ʃ/ diphtongue, written as *xh* which does not have a unique letter.

				## Grammar
				
				Articles similarly do not exist in *kharakar*, but are said and very occasionally written, as t’ for the definite article and k’ for the indefinite. 
				
				*Kharakar* is head-final, not initial, and adjectives come before the noun. The latter is valid, though used less often. 
				
				SVO is the predominant word order, with OSV used in literature sometimes for poetic effect.
				
				### Conjugations and Tenses
				
				Verbs can end in ‘*en*, ‘*an*, and most commonly ‘*in* like *rekharhakr*.
				
				<table class="gb"><tr><td>Tense</td><td>‘*in*</td><td>‘*en*</td><td>‘*an*</td></tr><tr><td>Inf/Present</td><td>*in*</td><td>*en*</td><td>*an*</td></tr><tr><td>Past imperfect</td><td>*ins*</td><td>*ens*</td><td>*ans*</td></tr><tr><td>Past perf/pluperfect</td><td>*inir*</td><td>*enir*</td><td>*i*</td></tr><tr><td>Future</td><td>*ix*</td><td>*enk*</td><td>*ah*</td></tr><tr><td>Condl/past future</td><td>*ixa*</td><td>*enix*</td><td>*anix*</td></tr><tr><td>Imperative</td><td>*ii*</td><td>*er*</td><td>*ai*</td></tr></table>	
				
				The doer modifier is ‘*as*, ‘*ak* or ‘*ask*, rather than ‘*ark*.

			<h1 id="3">Hakr</h1>
			<p class="subheading">Ancient Draconic / Classical Draconic</p>
			<div class="md-conv">
				
				
				An ancient version of modern Rekharhakr, it has no base writing system of its own, taking on the writing system of whatever other civilisation that happened to pick it up. It spread through Ancient Aseron, out from the Spring of the Earth, east to the lowlands of the Ancient Empire, and west past the Kashgan Mountains to Parsor. 
				
				Generally, words are mutually intelligible or close to rekharhakr, however Ancient Draconic often does not disambiguate words. For example, thur is water, but can also mean lake, ocean, or any still body of water. 
				
				Grammar is similarly carried out as in rekharhakr, but conjugations are handled slightly differently.
				
				The th sound was more of a hiss ss, and the f/v sound was one sound, denoted usually as v. 
				
				> Note on notation
				> Sometimes, certain vowels are barely stressed / pronounced at all, and should have only very, very light emphasis placed on them. If they would make a syllable when enunciated, they often don’t. For example, embers (*[a]srákh*) is counted as one syllable, because the leading *a* is barely enunciated. Representing this can be one by either round (preferred) or square (when nested) brackets. 
		
				> Often when writing ancient hakr in the draconic script these half-enunciations are not marked.
				
				## Ancient Grammar
				
				Negation is done by adding ‘*da* to the end of the word.
				
				It is prudent, sometimes, to add a vowel at the end of words for effect. This is a practice mostly dropped in modern draconic. This vowel is always unstressed, and marked with an ‘.
				
				Otherwise, the suffix system is similar to modern draconic, ‘on for possession, ‘*ad* for grouping, ‘*ak* for agent nouns.
				
				### Verbs
				
				There are no explicit verbs in Ancient Draconic, rather to “verb a noun” one can just add n to a word if it ends in a verb, or ‘*n* (sometimes pronounced *in* / [ən]) if it ends in a consonant. Conjugations are also less present, and it is necessary sometimes to distinguish between different tense periods (such as past/pluperfect) using time adverbs.
