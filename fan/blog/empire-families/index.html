The Ancient Empire of Asyria has long marked the passage of time by the rise and fall of its dynastic cycles, one dynasty replacing the next, often with brutal, bloody civil war in between. It is one of the earliest civilisations to ever emerge in the world, and the rule of the first King of Yan as the first Emperor of All Asyria denoted the first year of AD, the age of dragonkind.
