The current Holy Kingdom of Rivian, is a feudal semi-theocracy lead by a pope-king, who is sovereign over all provinces in the heartland, and suzerain of all dominions in the exterior. Each province is ruled by a noble family, which often change through the ages, whether by war, intrigue, or just the lack of a male heir. The current list, sorted roughly in importance within the Kingdom, shows the noble houses of the provinces, in the year 447, reign of Augustin III.
