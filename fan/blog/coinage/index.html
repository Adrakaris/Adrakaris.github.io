				In the known world, are three main centres of civilisation: Rivian in the west, Parsor in the centre, and the Ancient Empire in the East. The bulk of the coinage within their continents descend from these three places, and used alongside native currencies and precious metals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most civilisations have historically used a gold or silver standard, with the west preferring gold, and the east silver. However, the dwarven kingdoms prefer to use the metal Mythril as their base metal of trade. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Notes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The value of these currencies are compared against the <i>Rivenian Gold Crown</i>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Currency denomination in <i>italic</i> are less often used, and often out of circulation. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Bold</b> denotes the main "base" unit, such as the Crown, even if few pesants could hope to have a complete gold crown in their hands. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Dacrame</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="cbox">
			<h3>The Rivenian Gold Crown</h3>

			<p>
				Denoted Gsc, the Crown is the most widely used currency in Dacrame, being the primary currency of Rivian, but accepted widely elsewhere. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					P | <i>Old Platinum Soverign</i> (1P. = 10G)
				</li>
				<li>
					G | <b>Gold Crown</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Half-Crown / Electrum Piece</i> (½G)
				</li>
				<li>
					s | Silver Piece (10s. = 1G)
				</li>
				<li>
					c | Copper Penny (100c. = 1G)
				</li>
				<li>
					fr | i | Frisian Iron Standard (200i. = 1G)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The crown is a solid gold coin of about 1/4 troy ounces, etched with the face of the ruling monarch on one side, and the four seals of Rivian (Rivian, Teucania, Alvycia, and Leonparte). It is of very high value, and is often rarely seen or used by the pesantry. It is round, as is the penny, whilst the silver piece is a heptagon.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Frisia, copper pennies are often replaced with the iron standard, worth half the price. These are minted by the Frisian Iron bank and pegged to the Crown.
			</p>

			<h3>The Elyrian Talent</h3>

			<p>
				Denoted Gds (or Tds, Γδς, Τδς), the Talent is minted by the banks of the Helios States, and pegged to the Rivenian Crown. They are generally interchangeable with Rivenian currency, but not minted by the Rivenian banks. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					G | T | <b>Gold Talent</b> 
				</li>
				<li>
					d | Silver Drachai (10d = 1G)
				</li>
				<li>
					s | Bronze Sim (100s = 1G)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The Gold Talent is etched with the owl of Kleios, and bears the words "ellyrika talent" in the elyrian script. The Silver Drachai bears the image of a horse behind a wheat stalk, and the Bronze sim is pressed with the image of a grapevine and a sun.
			</p>

			<h3>The Mauentyr Invar Standard</h3>

			<p>
				Denoted IK, this currency is the one most commonly used by the dwarves of Mauentyr and the mountains of Dacrame. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					M | <i>Mythril Tyr</i> (1M = 40G)
				</li>
				<li>
					I | <b>Invar Standard</b> (4I = 1G)
				</li>
				<li>
					K | Constantan Piece (40K = 1G, 10K = 1I)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Whilst general goods may be traded in Rivenian Gold, any weaponry or dwarven metal products must be traded on the Invar Standard. The Mythril Tyr used to be an ancient widely circulated currency, but with one coin being very valuable, large caches of Tyres were a target for thieves. The reserve bank of Mauentyr possesses a cache of Tyres, but they are not usually withdrawable to the public unless specifically requested.
			</p>
			<p>
				All Mauren coinage has a round hole punched in the centre. The Tyr is round, with images of Ingvar and Kleios, the Invar Standard is square with notched sides, and the Konstanton Piece is square. They all bear intricate dwarven patterns.

			<h3>Imperial Silver</h3>

			<p>
				In the Ancient Empire, silver, both in ingot and loose form, remains the dominant currency. Everything is dominated in tael-weights of silver, or the coins that make it up. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Gold, on the other hand, is rarely used, and usually not cast into coins. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					尙銀 | <i>Hallowed Silver</i> (50G a tael)
				</li>
				<li>
					白銀 | <b>Silver</b> (½G a tael, 100 to hallowed silver)
				</li>
				<li>
					铜文 | Copper Cash (100 to a tael of silver)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				A tael-weight of silver is around 37.5 grams, and is the reference for all coinage. Because it is a weight of precious metal, and not necessarily a coin, there is no, nor does there need to be any enforced standard, though the royal mints of the various dynasties of the East do produce copper cash, as well as cast ingots of silver, which all can be referenced against.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Copper cash (<i>Wen</i>) is set at 100 cash to one tael of silver, and is a round coin with a square hole, commonly strung on strings. The convention is 100 coins to a string, thus making a string of cash one silver tael. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hallowed Silver (<i>Shang Yin</i>) is the highest and rarest denomination, much like the Mythril Tyr of Mauentyr. It is not silver, rather an alloy of two metals: mythril and <i>dragonsilver</i>, the production of the latter is a highly guarded secret of the Jang dynasty. Though Hallowed Silver is measured in "taels", one "tael" of hallowed silver is actually 1.2 taels, since it is set as 1 tael of mythril, and one tail of dragonsilver.
			</p>

			<h3>The Parsii Nadí</h3>

			<p>
				Denoted Njfh, the Nadí is the main currency of the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax (Parsor) in the near east. 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					N | <b>Gold Nadí</b> (2N = 1G)
					
				</li>
				<li>
					j | Gold half-Nadí (4j = 1G, 2j = 1N)
					
				</li>
				<li>
					f | Silver Fidin (20f = 1G, 10f = 1N)
					
				</li>
				<li>
					h | Copper Has (200h = 1G, 100h = 1f)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				One of the oldest coinages in the world, in the current era it is used exclusively within Parsor and its neighbouring states in the desert, with few making their way west. Parsii coins are generally smaller than Rivenian coins, and are worth less.
