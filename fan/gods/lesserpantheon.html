                    <p>
                        【中】死神、堕落之主
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Golmak was once well respected within the pantheon of the Old Gods, as the God of Death. He was the taker of departed souls, but in his avarice, always wanted more, greater. This caused his sharp fall from grace, when he tried to take a soul more powerful than any in existence: the soul of a fellow deity. He tried in folly to steal the soul of Chara, but was bested, resulting in his defeat and condemnation to an eternity of torture and pain.

                    <p>
                        He resides in the Deep Dark, so much a shadow that he is the shadow itself. Any who venture too far into the shadow of the Dark will slowly be consumed, by what is no longer a god but rather a ravenous beast.

                        【中】九泉之主、黄泉之主
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aligheri was once a human, the most wretched and corrupt of his race. His cruelty and barbarism landed him in the deepest, darkest part of the <a class="green" href="">City of Mors</a>, in its heart, but even still the torment did not affect him. He reveled in the torture and pain, and through the magic of this realm his joy was turned upon him and corrupted him, until he was no longer a man but a fiend, a fiend more frightening and unhallow than any that preceeded him, more than the once mighty Golmak.

                        The Seven Judges, or Seven Gods of Man, are the first seven children of Estia. They lead the Heavenly Council, that judges the dead, regulates the lesser gods, and acts as a mediator of heavenly dispute. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "The fairest Heaven is an unfeeling Heaven" is their iron principle, and an unfeeling heaven is what they maintain. They do not interfere with the mortal plane, and make action through inaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though the Seven have names, they are unknown, and worshippers of the Seven Gods simply refer to them as "The Seven".

                    <p>
                        【中】兩龍，雙龍、雨神、月尊
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The two brothers were birthed when the old gods still walked the land, in the Age of Creation, and were the descent of god and mortal. Raised in the heart of Aseron, they grew to be unlike any other dragon, or any other mortal being, for that matter, being able to influence nature around them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the start the rains were made by Asyr Shai, and reflecting her nature they either came in devastating storms, or not at all, and under this the people suffered until the two brothers decided to take pity. They found that together they could control the rains, and for a while the mortals prospered. Asyr Shai noticed, eventually, and was angered at what they were doing, so she split them, making their power weaker. One is said to remain in Aseron, whilst the other lives in Qara Qai.

                    <p>
                        The White Prophet was a human man who lived many thousands of years ago, in the ancient kingdom of Yr, later part of the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, in the first age of dragonkind. He was called Iras, and came from a poor fishing family. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is said that he was out on the beach alone one day, when he had a vision: A great platinum dragon appeared before him from the depths of the ocean. It walked up to him out of the sea, and grasped his soul in one claw. He heard the words <I>"diisn hrav, ysan ta'i"</I>, walk the path, teach the way. His hair turned white, and a bright flame flared in his eye, before his sight went black. He returned from the beach a blind man with a mystical truesight, teaching what he called "the way".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prophet had long ascended by now, but his teachings remain with the society of Parsor, to always be just, to always uphold order, and to follow the path lead by the White Prophet, to Xiron Shai.

                    <p>
                        Theianos was once a mortal prince of an ancient city, in modern-day Teucania. One day, he was sailing with his cousin, and when they were far out to sea, his cousin cast him into the waves, and left him to die. Alone on the great blue, Theianos drifted for forty days and forty nights, the sun beating down on him from above, the water clutching him from below, yet against all odds he did not die. Rather, he drifted far, until he finally washed up, on a beach near Makedonia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Delirious and near-to-death, he saw an apparition standing above him, a sun standing on the earth, as the air around him burned, yet he was unharmed. The sun spoke to him with a voice that echoed through the heavens, commanding him to rise. As newfound energy washed through him, Theianos rose, and knelt at the sun's feet, at <i>Asyr's</i> feet, and pledged the life she offered back to him, to serve as the Sun, and bring daylight.
