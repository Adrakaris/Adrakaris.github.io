## The Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax

【Names】Empire of Atun'Orizan, Parsii Empire 【<span class="draconic">REKH</span>】<span class="draconic">KHANKHARIK ATUN ORISAN</span> 【中】皇沙    
*Population: 14.6 million; Currency: Gold Nadí*

The Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, often shortened down to just Parsor, referring to its senior kingdom, is more a collection of various multi-cultured kingdoms under one single banner, than a unitary state in its own right. The Empire is ruled over by a king of kings, termed the Shaa'khan, from his seat in Shaer Paedeshkhan, and as the divine disciple of the White Prophet is given absolute rule over all of his domain. In reality though, the various kings under the Shaakhan have significant autonomy in inner affairs, gaining slowly more and more power ever since the end of the Second Age of Dragonkind. 

The term "Parsor" itself formally only refers to the western and largest portion of the Empire, which is governed by the Shaa'khan directly as the King (or Shah) of Parsor. Other states swear fealty and pledge their armies to the Shaakhan in times of war, otherwise only paying nominal tribute to the King of Kings. These vassal states are the Kingdoms of Lamytov, Tsien'na, Khantorum, Ashralan, Qorom, and Al Mahib.

#### Parsor 

*Parsii*    
The largest kingdom of the Empire, and home to the royal seat of *Shaer Padeshkhan*, the ancient City of Kings, standing upon a lonely mountain in a sea of sand. Parsor occupies an arid steppe and desert landscape, with few rivers and sparse cities, yet its fertile pockets and few river valleys prove invaluable to its people. Shaer Padeshkhan's reach once stretched as south as the endless sea, and as west as the leviathan wastes, and its fall left many new duchies and kingdoms in its place, free from the empire's control.

#### Lamytov

*Laemyran*    
Once a southern duchy of Velyrs, it is the last piece of Parsor's northern marches still in its control, being south of a mountain range that has mostly stopped the advance of the Great Horde, and isolating it from the rest of Dacrame. It now forms the frontline against any prospective invasion from the north.

#### Tsien'na
*Nannite*    
Historically Tsien'na was one of the more dragon-populated kingdoms, as hinted at by its names, with many of the noble families of Old Parsor finding their roots close by. It is now a small, poor, and sparsely populated land, only receiving attention from the City of Kings due to the important fortress of Ashad's Hold.

#### Khantorum
*Caenite*    
Khantorum is one of the wealthier kingdoms, with its capital of Shankhum by a large lake, that separates the western "homelands" from the "wildlands" eastwards. This large lake has supported a large population in the kingdom, and the river that meanders south is a great source of trade. 

#### Ashralan 
*Ashralan*   
Ashralan was once the seat of a minor baron, and used to be part of the Kingdom of Khantorum. The Lord of Ashralan however proved to be invaluable to the overthrow of the old monarchy, and as thanks were granted a domain of their own by Shaer Padeshkhan, much to the annoyance of its eastern neighbour.

#### Al Mahib 
*Lascerian*    
Ruled by the Al Mahib family, this kingdom is the most different from the rest of the Empire, being culturally closer to their southern Sultan states, and the only Sultanate that the Empire has retained within its own dominion. 

#### Qorom 
*Qoromite*    
Often called the Holy Kingdom of Qorom, or the Holy City of Qorom, this kingdom is a religious centre for the entire region. Many make pilgrimage to its silver temple to make offerings to the gods, as well as bathe in the waters of the lake that run under its shadow. 

## Dragonshome 
【Names】The House of the Honourable Speaker【<span class="draconic">REKH</span>】<span class="draconic">REKHAXIN</span>【中】正音家    
*Population: 14 thousand*

Deep in the mountains, the old draconic nobility of Parsor fled, and built a loose alliance to protect themselves. They call it the *House of the Honourable Speaker*, in reference to their elected regent, whilst the Parsii fittingly just call it "Dragonshome". Over hundreds of years, as human empires conquered the wild, Dragonshome saw numerous wild dragon clans from all across the world come to seek refuge. 

The lands of dragonshome are wild, little cultivated, with wild beasts roaming its grasslands and arid crags, with undulating chains of mountains for many to make home. Their borders are ill defined, and they do not govern like any ordinary kingdom would.

Dragonshome is lead by a regent called the *Honourable Speaker*, who is elected every century to lead his House, an alliance of all dragonkind who wish to bow to him. Under the speaker's house, one must abide by his laws, few they may be, and give tribute to the fortress of Dragonshome. In return, the speaker must mediate dispute, and if an outsider were to harm any under his care, retaliate without mercy. If one did not wish to bow to the speaker however, they were free to live within his domain unhindered, yet unable to request his aid.

Due to its somewhat peculiar status, Dragonshome is well known about in both the west and east, appearing in documents in Trier, and records in Jang. 

#### The Wastes of Samakhan
Samakhan was once also a kingdom of Parsor. Three hundred years ago, the prince of Samakhan, in an attempt to impress a princess and win her hand, decided to offer her a dragon's treasure. He lead a band of elite soldiers into Dragonshome, and slew a dragon for his horde. Yet as he returned back to Samarkhan in glory, the sleeping giant behind him stirred. 

The dragon's clansmen flew to the Honourable Speaker with this news, and as that slain dragon was under his protection, he sent an army a thousand strong against the Kingdom of Samarkhan, razing its cities to the ground, killing all its men, women and children, and left that same prince impaled on the minaret spike on the highest building in the ruins of his capital. 

Shaer Padeshkhan, just coming out of a succession crisis, did not dare retaliate, fearing that if the Honourable Speaker were to muster the full might of his wild dragons, the empire would crumble under this devastation. Now Samarkhan lies a smouldering ruin, a reminder never to provoke the mountain nation.
