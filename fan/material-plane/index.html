Through the many ages, many great kingdoms had come and go, rising to power and falling to ruin. Through the many ages, the many varied races of this world waxed and waned, fighting with each other, amongst themselves, or cooperating together to build sprawling civilisations. Much of this world lies untamed, with a few thriving hubs of civilisation, ruled now in majority by Mankind, in their age.

The continents were named long ago, in an ancient Draconic tongue from the First Age of Dragonkind, and these names have slowly filtered down, warped, and sometimes changed, to the ones used today. The names provided are those used predominantly in the Great Kingdom of Rivian.

## Dacrame, the Known World

【<e-drac>REKH</e-drac>】<span class="draconic">DIR KROMEA</span>【中】夕洲

*The Iridescent Land, as named in Draconic*

Dacrame is the land upon the Great Blue Sea, the stronghold of civilisation since the Age of Steel. At its beating heart lies the still strong remanant of a great empire, serving as the centre of trade and culture of the western world. The land is fractured, many kings and emperors ruling small parcels of land, locked in endless competition. Here is young ideas flourish: the pantheons of Gods both old and new; the philosophy of morality, thought, and existence, all discussed, pondered and written into scriptures that would fit great libraries for powerful kings.

Comparatively, though, Dacrame harbours younger empires than several other places within the Material Plane.

The borders of Dacrame stretches from the Insel Fries in the west, to the Drakou and further the Jugalvisk mountains in the East, from the furthest south island of Hélios to where civilisation ends in the North.

## Aseron, the Far East, the Land of Ancients

【<e-drac>REKH</e-drac>】<e-drac>ASIIRON</e-drac>【中】晏洲（讀安）

*Asiiron, "Of Asyr Shai", the land where the dragons were born, and thus where Asyr bestowed her grace*

The lands of Aseron are mysterious and ancient, with a history and a civilisation spanning multiple millenia, back to the first Age, the Age of Fire. Since long ago a tentative trade network has flowed between east and west, from the far east to Dacrame, yet still the two sides know little about each other, only hearing vague tales and stories.

None known have yet dared the perilous journey east, but rumours say that should they make it, they will be welcomed into the Ancient Empire of the East, where the palaces and temples are gold and blue shingle, and all, even dragonkind, bow to their Emperor, Son of Heaven.

It is said that the dragons were born here, around the *World Spring*, deep within the western mountains, yet few if any have ever dared venture further west, as these holy mountains carry deep secrets, that affect the primordial magical energy that permates the world.

## Aseron, the Near East, Deserts of Sun and Twisted Flax

【中】皇沙

In the heart of the continent of Aseron lies a gargantuan mountain chain, splitting the continent in two. To the east, lies the fertile river valleys of the Ancient Empire. To the west, is noguht but arid plains, desert, and wasteland. 

From this desert land arose another civilisation, with its centre at the *Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax*, Parsor, that ruled the few rivers and desert oases, stretching once from the borders of Dacrame to the Leviathan Wastes in the far east. 

Parsor has since antiquity facilitated a small trade between the kingdoms of Dacrame and the dynastic empire in Aseron, but within that mountain chain lies deep secrets, that affect the flow of magic, preventing true communication across it.

## The Sea of Shattered Stars

【中】碎星海

*Named after the sparse islands that inhabit the sea*

Surrounding Aseron is an endless sea. Travelling east, the continent breaks up and makes way for countless islands, scattered over a stretch of ocean so vast none from the mainland have crossed it.

These islands range from the size of craggy rocks to hundreds of miles wide, and the Asyrians have termed these islands the "Shattered Stars". Thus, arises the name of the sea.

The Sea of Shattered Stars is sparsely populated, and the seas and islands are often home to ferocious beasts, that make human colonisation difficult if not impossible. No great power known has established itself within these islands, and the distance between them make even flight difficult.

Of the habitable islands, ordinary people make up the comparative minority, with most people possessing either some magical or martial ability. The idea of State and Empire has never permeated this realm, and islands are often controlled by martial clans and magical sects, than kings and emperors.

## Marakar, the Land of Eternal Winter

【<e-drac>REKH</e-drac>】<e-drac>MARAKAI</e-drac>【中】永寒

*The Land of Eternal Winter*

North of the Frieshan Peninsula, of the Visigean Tribes and Tarkarvia, is a hostile place covered in eternal winter. The Kingdoms in Dacrame know only that their north shore borders a frigid sea, beyond which is presumed to be a vast archipelago, the lands getting colder and colder with each step further. Those in Aseron know of an unexplored and hostile land, past the Dongping shore, where mysterious tribes peoples practice their eldritch rituals. This hostile place is far beyond the control of any established empire, whether that be Rivian, Frisia, the Ancient Empire, or the Khaganate.

Stories are told of wild tribesmen who repel any attempts at diplomacy, and raiders occasionally hitting Northern shores. Their makeup, as well, isn't human, being fierce otherworldly creatures and human like beings. The most temperate land within Marakar is a frigid island named by the Fries as Coubaersz, after the Cumbaer, the only tribe of these north peoples who seem to be receptive to diplomacy. Still, any attempt at establishing more advanced relations have failed.

Marakar stretches East to West from Coubaersz to the frozen eastern seas. To the north is completely unknown, and people have theorised that Marakar ends in a great wall of ice, the end of the world.

## Qara Qai, Land of the Fifth Sun

Qara Qai is the only truly unknown lands. None from the known world have set foot in this place. No legends speak of it, almost no folklore suggests its existence. It is, in this, truly isolated. The only legend which perhaps hints at its existence is the [Tale of Two Brothers](../blog/lianglong/), where the Younger Brother is banished far to a land on the other side of the world, never to return.

Qara Qai is a lush continent, sparsely populated, with few Kingdoms, and many uncivilised tribes migrating across its great forests and plains.

There are only two true kingdoms, those who could rival some realms in Dacrame. Qetzlan, an empire of peoples who through the ages and profane rituals, are now more serpentine than human; and Aakcarin, a republic of elves, aasimar, and other races somewhat of a rarity in the old world.

### Introduction

The world of Caeleste Mare is split broadly into three eras, and seven (seen sometimes as eight) ages throughout. The world itself is of unknown age, and even older is the celestial sea it floats on, but what is sure is that the old gods Asyr and Xiron first arose, followed slowly by the rest of the greater pantheon, completing only when Moira drifted in from the void.

In general though, the world eras can be delineated as thus:

### The Three Eras and Seven Ages

In the beginning, there was nothing save the old gods. Over a span of millions and millions of years, they formed the outer planes, then fought and competed to create more, creating a network of countless islands that float through the sea. Many of these make up the unformed lands. This is the **Dark Era**

> Only one age is counted in this era, the **Age of Ancients**, lasting **countless millions** of years.

Then came the light, as the three near realms were made: the Deep Dark by the Golmak the Sheperd, the Twilight by Valaan the Father, and this Material realm by Asyr and Xiron. Onto these worlds were born various races and peoples, modelled after the gods themselves. Much here has been lost in the mist of time, and ancient secrets lie hidden. This is the **Desolate** or **Ancient Era**.

> The **Age of Fire** came first, marking the time before vast empires and feudal realms controlled the land, from the time of tribes and confederations to networks of small kingdoms within fertile plains. It lasted **countless millions** of years.

> The conquest of the central plains by the King of Yan marked the start of the **Former Age of Dragonkind**, where the first true kingdoms and empires formed, histories began to be written in great detail, and dragonkind predominantly ruled the land. It saw the Yan unify the central plains, the Kingdom of Parsor arise in the west, and the old cities of Helion form alliances and develop statecraft. This lasted **6,090 years**.

> The fall of the House of Li in the east marks the beginning of the **Age of Steel**, which saw the power of the old draconic nobility waver throughout the world and unrest grip the land, but also the development of technology, literature, philosophy, and the rise of a small city state of Rivianum in Dacrame. This lasted **2,850 years**.

> The formation of the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, and the unification of the central plains by the draconic house of Zhou marks the **Latter Age of Dragonkind**, where again draconic nobility came to rule much of the world. This was a time when Rivianum, now the Empire of Rivian, expanded throughout Dacrame, and power began to centralise. This lasted **9,910** years. 

In this year 18,850 years since the former age of dragonkind, the world saw another wave of unrest, greater and more deadly than ever before, as famine and war enveloped all known continents of the material plane. This unrest brought to end the rule of the dragons, starting with the slow collapse of the Rivenian Empire into numerous smaller kingdoms, followed soon after by Parsor, and culminating in the decline and end of the House of Yin in the east. This is called the **Common**, or **New Era**.

> The short era from the end of the Rivenian Empire, to the re-formation fo the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax under a new human house is termed the **Age of Rebirth**, describing a period of turmoil that saw the landed races break free of the rule of the old nobility and try forge their own path. It lasted only **170 years**.

> Finally, scholars in the west term the current era the **Age of Humanity**, counting **447 years** until the present day. However, the Yin in the east only came to an end some two centuries ago, leaving the empire largely in the control of the human house of Wu, who rule as the dynasty of Shang.
