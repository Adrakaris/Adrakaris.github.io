That's it.

I'm done.

I've got notes from CS1XX modules (kinda) to CS4XX, but the university doesn't have any higher coded modules and frankly my student debt is already so high that I have no hope of paying it off even with a decent salary. 

Instead, I have left the bountiful and fertile plains of ... Coventry 

> ... okay, maybe not "bountiful" and "fertile", need to work on that 

...and instead moved to a dreary and desolate land, where the sun shines not, the skies are grey, the people are sullen; a place abandoned by God -- also known as "the North of England".

Admittedly, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but in any case I've done my time and will be moving on. I heard from a magpie that there is a curriculum overhaul planned at DCS, and so many of these modules (especially the lower coded ones) are likely to see significant changes or be out of date sometime in the next few years.

If you're a poor lost soul who has to commute 40 minutes from Leamington Spa every morning, or worse, live in Rootes (joking, joking...) then you should take heed that these notes are old and only getting older; I'm not going to update them with new content, but I will try to correct small typos every now and then if you can tell me about them on Discord.

That said, the content in there is still legitimate content, and is probably still going to be helpful even quite a few years down the line. 

I don't intend to take these notes down anytime soon, by the way.
