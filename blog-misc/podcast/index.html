				I featured in an episode on my friend Leo's podcast, YASP. You can listen to it <a href="https://yasp.show/episodes" class="text">here</a>, or on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly95YXNwLnNob3cvYXRvbS54bWw" class="text">Google Podcasts</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3ZkM1l13q6VPFngcOk5M8A?si=gfiDqUvfQ6GEVA3cJTk86Q&nd=1" class="text">Spotify</a>. It's called <i>Insert Tearable Pun Here</i> (because paper, ha HA), and is the seventh episode in the series. To quote from the site;
			</p>

					We’re back from a long hiatus! On this episode of YASP, I’m joined by Yijun. We delve into traditional Chinese arts, seal stamp carving, brush calligraphy, and lightly touch on DnD and world-building. We also discuss origami and the his surprisingly large percentage of his budget dedicated high-end paper.

				We chatted for just over an hour about all the topics included above, as well as a bit on tech and gaming. There was a story at the start about how I got my current phone, but unfortunately it did not make the edit, due to recording issues. I'll include it below though.
			</p>

			<p>	
				My current phone is a Vivo V15, that I got in 2019. Now Vivo does not sell in this country (Oppo and OnePlus do), and so of course I didn't get it in this country. Before I got my current phone, I had a Samsung C5 (which yes, also cannot be bought in this country, but beside the point). I'm not the most <i>deft</i> with holding a phone, and have dropped it before, onto concrete no less, but it survived a good two+ years. During a trip to Thailand with a friend's family that easter of 2019, I did the thing again, and managed to fumble and drop my phone, however this time the Thai concrete bested it, and <i>*crack*</i>, it was dead.
			</p>

			<p>
				So I was in trouble. Big trouble. Not having a phone is pretty much a "can't do" now. Thus, we decided to get me a new phone in Bangkok, and I chanced upon the V15, which just released that year. It had no notch (nor bezel), the camera was a pop-up which was a cool but otherwise unimportant feature, had decent specs and cost about £280 in Thai Baht, so I decided to go for it. Thankfully, it's lasted me until today.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm rather religious with keeping screen protectors on now.

				For more stuff, including revelations on my <i>awful, awful</i> Windows programming setup (I plan to buy an SSD and dual boot linux as soon as possible), trashing on Windows in general, a casual chat about war crimes in Rimworld and Stellaris, and of course origami, seal script, chinese art, and more. Go have a listen!
